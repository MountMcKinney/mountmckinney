          Welcome to <a href="<?php echo BASE_URL; ?>">Mount McKinney&#039;s</a> world famous Campfire Stories! Do you enjoy ghost stories scary enough to stop your heart? No? No worries, we don&#039;t tell those here. Ghost stories should only be told around an actual campfire where we can all enjoy warm, toasty s&#039;mores to provide comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          If not ghost stories, what will sorts of stories will be told? How about tales of adventure with hints of comedy and wit? Adventures so intriguing you&#039;ll be on the edge of your seat while reading them, and if you&#039;re standing, you&#039;ll find a chair just to be on the edge of your seat. There may be the occasional tall tale from time to time in there as well, but isn&#039;t embelishment what turns a good story into a great one?
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time a wandering hiker will drop by to provide a tale from their journeys. Are you an outdoorsy person with a tale to weave for all of us? If so, send us an <a href="mailto:john@mountmckinney.com">email</a>, fill out the <a href="#" class="contactPopUp">Contact form</a>, or send us a <a href="http://www.pigeongram.com/" target="_blank">Carrier Pigeon</a>. Bonus points and free s&#039;mores for using that last one.
