                        The short answer: Our prices vary depending on your needs. We would never give you a quote without talking to you and figuring out the specifics. However, based on prior experience we do have ballpark ranges on our <a href='http://mountmckinney.com/service/?service=web-development'>Web Development & Design</a> page.
                        <br/ >
                        The long answer: To truly find what it will cost, we need to have a conversation with you. We are all about relationships here at Mount McKinney and we need to find out what functionality you need in a site, what the site&apos;s purpose is, etc. After speaking with you we can work on a firm quote taking into account your specific situation and needs.
                        <br />
                        Just like most things that are as variable as building a website, if a web developer gives you an instant quote, run away like you&apos;re being chased by <span>Sasquatch</span>! (Perferrably right to us!)

                      Quick fixes are projects we determine will take <strong>30 minutes or less</strong>. Each quick fix is for only one small project. For example: creating an email account, fixing errors, and providing a security scan are 3 separate quick fixes. If you need multiple fixes done on your site, please <a href='https://mountmckinney.typeform.com/to/IUHF6N' data-mode='1' target='_blank'>contact us</a> for a custom quote.

                      Quick fixes are always paid in advance. Payment is collected via PayPal or credit card. Please ensure the information you provide when purchasing a quick fix is the correct and the easiest to get in touch with you so we can resolve your project as fast as possible.

                      See below for examples of quick fixes. If you have questions about whether something is a quick fix or not, you can always shoot us a quick <a href='mailto:info@support.mountmckinney.com?Subject=What%27s%20a%20Quick%20Fix%3F'>email</a>.

                      If for any reason we deem the project as not being a quick fix or are unable to resolve your issue, Mount McKinney will refund your money immediately. If it is a situation where we deem the fix will take longer than 30 minutes we will reach out with a quote for you.
