                    In my initial planning of the trip I expected us to get into Doolin too late to see the Cliffs and today would be when we saw them. However, I didn&apos;t realize how late the Sun sets in summer in Ireland. So instead we decided to explore what else County Clare had to offer, we packed our lunch (because we&apos;re frugal like that) and headed out.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Our first stop was to see the Burren. The Burren is the smallest of Ireland&apos;s six National Parks but is definitely the most unique. The entire region is covered in limestone which formed there as sediment over 350 million years ago. The Burren has been compared to walking on the moon due to the large amount of rock covering the landscape. While I can&apos;t confirm those reports as sadly I&apos;ve yet to leave this planet on an adventure, I can confirm it was unique, to say the least. Our only hike in the Burren was to see the Poulnabrone Dolmen, a large portal tomb. As we drove through the Park we would look out on the rolling hills and it was grey everywhere we looked.

                    From the Burren we continued exploring County Clare we stumbled across <a href='http://www.hazelmountainchocolate.com/'>Hazel Mountain Chocolate</a>. This small chocolate shop and cafe had some delicious chocolate (though it was definitely expensive). If you like chocolate, which why wouldn&apos;t you, you should stop in and see this small chocolate shop. Right across a field from the chocolate shop is Corcomroe Abbey. The ruins of this 13th Century Cistercian were beautiful, if you have the time, I recommend making the Corcomroe Abbey a stop while exploring the Burren. Heading out toward Coole Park for a late lunch, our path was suddenly stopped by cows! It brought us great amusement to have a road completely stopped by cows. I am still looking for my path to be stopped by sheep but cows will work too.

                    The juxtaposition between our morning hike in the Burren and where we stopped for a late lunch was incredible. Our lunch spot was at Coole Park, a nature reserve in south County Galway. If you&apos;re nearby and need a relaxing spot to take a walk, eat lunch, or just enjoy a rare sunny Irish day I can think of no place better than Coole Park.

                    Upon arriving in Coole Park we headed into a walled courtyard area to eat lunch. We ended up feeling so relaxed we took a nap in the Sun on the field. While the Burren was desolate and rocky, Coole Park was alive with all kinds of flowers and tall trees. To me the Burren was interesting and Coole Park was beautiful. If you&apos;d like to walk, there are two trails for you, the Family Path and the Seven Woods Path. The Family Path is only 1.5km and is a good length for a relaxing stroll in the woods. The Seven Woods Path is 4.5km and is incredibly relaxing. I highly recommend you take the longer path, it&apos;s definitely worth it.

We even found a small round castle because, of course. Ireland has random unmarked castles. We ended our evening with another hike along Cliffs of Moher and watching the sunset.

                    Our ninth day in Ireland was not filled with much of anything other than relaxation and taking it easy. We didn&apos;t rush anywhere, we didn&apos;t even know what we would see that day other than the Burren and Coole Park. If I was to plan the trip again I wouldn&apos;t have had us stay in Doolin an extra day as it would&apos;ve allowed us to see County Donegal or even Northern Ireland, but hindsight is 20/20 and I didn&apos;t mind the day of relaxation.

                    Taking a break from our series of Irish adventure stories, it&apos;s October, which means it&apos;s time for my annual trip to the Smoky Mountains to check out the changing leaves and hike in the mountains. This year it was me and 3 other friends. We packed up the truck and headed north to the mountains! We decided to camp in Smokemont campgrounds which is right inside the Smoky Mountain National Park on the Cherokee, NC side.

                    About an hour from Asheville on I-26, we came to a complete stop. Waze changed our time til arrival from one hour to two. I put the truck in park at one point waiting for the traffic to move. The 3 miles to the next exit were brutal. I didn&apos;t really care what the exit was I was sure it would save us time. We pulled off and let Waze direct us the rest of the way, it saved us about an hour, maybe more. The other thing it did was save my sanity. I&apos;d much rather have a trip take a little longer as long as I&apos;m actually moving. Sitting on the interstate isn&apos;t fun. Winding our way through back roads would become a theme of the trip, which isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing in my opinion.

                    We entered Great Smoky Mountain National Park and saw a large sign warning us to be cautious due to elk. We figured the odds of actually seeing an elk were low until we saw 10 or so cars pulled over. There in the field were two large elk, one female and one male. We quickly pulled over and snapped a couple pics.

                    As we neared the campsite the temperature dropped considerably and the rain rolled in. Arriving at Smokemont in the dark and light rain made for a fun campsite setup. Thankfully, we got the campfire going quickly and I had my tent setup in a few minutes. Immediately after the last of our group had thrown on their rainfly, the rain stopped. We had set up camp and were ready for dinner...until we realized something. We had forgotten something very important at home...chairs!

                    It was already just after 8pm and dark, we headed into Cherokee hoping we would get lucky and find someone selling camp chairs. We stopped by a gas station to ask if they knew anywhere we could by a camping chair nearby. The woman laughed at us... Undeterred we drove around checking tourist shops, pawn shops, and gas stations. No luck anywhere and more than a few laughs and looks. We had given up when we saw one last gas station we hadn&apos;t tried yet. No camping chairs but there were pool floaties! Obviously not the most ideal solution but at least we could have a dry butt. The woman working at the store was very confused by us buying pool floaties while wearing sweaters. After explaining we didn&apos;t have chairs she looked at us with a large amount of pity.

                    The next morning we packed up and headed to hike along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Our first stop was Waterrock Knob. This short but steep hike rewards you with some incredible views. As we made our climb a bald eagle flew over our heads. One of my favorite things about this hike is that it has a lot of unobstructive views of different valleys as you make your trek up. Reaching the top, you could see miles upon miles of peaks and valleys. I&apos;ve always been mesmerized by mountains, I can stare at them for hours. Before heading back down, we met a dad celebrating his birthday by camping with his toddler. Apparently, they have a tradition that on his birthday and his son&apos;s birthday they go camping in the mountains. This seems like a tradition I may have to adopt.

                    After Waterrock Knob, we decided we didn&apos;t want to be at the campsite tonight without chairs so we made a pitstop at the Waynesville Walmart. We were finally all set for a night of enjoying the campfire. Getting back on the Blue Ridge we drove for a number of miles through incredible yellows, reds, and oranges. We stopped briefly for another short hike at the Devil&apos;s Courthouse and another at a random overlook we stopped at for a picture. Our last hike of the day was the longest and steepest. The trail to the top of Mt. Pisgah was beautiful, albeit freezing for us Florida boys. If you&apos;ve never hiked to the top of Mt. Pisgah, I highly recommend it. At the top was an incredible near 360&deg; view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. You&apos;ll be in a little bit of pain on the hike but that just makes the top that much more worth it.

                    Our second night of camping was colder than the first but just made the campfire that much better. We spent the night cracking jokes, drinking more whiskey, and just enjoying the incredible stargazing. I highly recommend checking out the Great Smokys for fall foliage next year. If you see me on the trail, make sure to say hi!

                    As we said farewell to the Dingle Peninsula we both said the same thing, &quot;We should&apos;ve stayed longer!&quot; We had seen most of what the peninsula had to offer in terms of new attractions but it was just such a peaceful and beautiful place. It was definitely not easy to begin our trip to Doolin especially because of the length of the drive ahead of us. However, we knew that the Cliffs of Moher lay at the end of the drive and we were eager to see one of Ireland&apos;s most famous landmarks.

                    Leaving from Ballyferriter, we took a mountain road called the Conor Pass. While driving through the Conor Pass we saw a vista point at the height of the road.

Climbing the hills next to the vista led us to a high hill with a 360&deg; view of the Pass. Hikers here had created a rock mound, with each hiker adding a rock to the pile. It was now a few feet in diameter and was almost as tall as I am.

                    Our drive to Doolin was rather uneventful (which I suppose is a good thing when said in that way). We stopped for a picnic lunch in a small town south of Shannon, Adare. Adare has thatch-style roofs and seeks to maintain the old Ireland-feel. If you ever find yourself driving through and need a place to stretch your legs, the park across from the Adare Heritage Center is a tranquil place to do so.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    From there we drove to Doolin. Arriving at our B&B in Doolin, we knew we needed to get out and explore one of Ireland&apos;s greatest treasures. Our B&B host told us of a small area on the side of the road we could park at and walk up to the Cliffs of Moher. To find the spot we parked at, go <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/fWmduwE1Txx'>here</a>. It&apos;s a small pull-off area that barely looks like you can park there but it&apos;s apparently where the locals park as you don&apos;t have to pay that way. What she didn&apos;t tell us is that walking up that way would be far more epic than the path most people take. This small path often led us to the edge of the Cliffs. There was even a sign reminding us of the dangers of the Cliffs.

                    We continued on the path for awhile and finally came to a paved area that had short walls stopping you before you go to the edge of the Cliffs. This much safer area was the official Cliffs of Moher. They had far more safety measures involved than the path up and it, in my opinion, took away from the grandeur of the experience. Maybe it was just in comparison to the dangers, even though they were small, but the safety we felt behind the walls never allowed us to experience the same &quot;woah&quot; moments where your stomach drops from the sheer drop below you. I understand why they have the walls, all I am saying is that when you go to the Cliffs of Moher, don&apos;t be afraid to take the small path beyond the signs warning you of the dangers of leaving the safe area.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    After spending the evening hiking the Cliffs, we knew we needed to head back to grab dinner before the restaurants stopped serving food at 9pm. This was something that was odd to me, the Sun didn&apos;t set until well into 10pm but restaurants stopped serving food well before that. So, if you were out hiking, you couldn&apos;t go out to eat unless you stopped hiking early.

                    Doolin is known for its traditional Irish music, so we made sure to chose a small pub that had live music that we could walk to from our B&B, Gus O&apos;Connor&apos;s Pub. The food was delicious and the music was a lot of fun to listen to. If you&apos;re looking for a place to grab a pint and listen to the music, O&apos;Connor&apos;s is a great choice.

                    We had read such great things about Doolin and how it is the center of classic Irish music. Doolin felt about the same size as Portmagee. While Portmagee felt quaint and we loved it, Doolin felt a little too touristy for us and often times too crowded. It was also not necessary to stay there to get the full Cliffs of Moher experience. I recommend staying in another town and driving into to see the Cliffs. We easily could have stayed in Ennis and Shannon as they aren&apos;t far from the Cliffs and drove in for the day. Galway City is a little further but we really enjoyed Galway and you could easily have Galway be a home base for you to make a day trip to the Cliffs.

                    Awaking late in Ballyferriter, we decided to make this a relaxing day where we slept in, ate breakfast while staring out the window at our incredible view, and just took our time checking out the gorgeous Dingle Peninsula. It was amazing how much slower life felt not just on the Dingle Peninsula but in most of Ireland. We were so far removed from the go-go-go culture here in the States. I loved the slower pace, made it easy to find new adventures.

                    It was Sunday, so our first stop was to go to Dingle to go church. We went to St. Mary&apos;s which is a very interesting parish. Their Mass is in Gaelic on the first Sunday of the month and the other Sunday Masses of the month are bilingual (Gaelic and English). It was a wonderful experience and one I highly recommend if for nothing else but the novelty of hearing the Gaelic language spoken so freely.

                    After Mass, there was a procession through the town (it&apos;s not a big town) because it was Corpus Christi Sunday. Corpus Christi is a feast day that celebrates the belief that all Catholics hold that the bread and wine the Priest holds up during Mass becomes the Body and Blood of the Lord, Jesus Christ. This procession was amazing to be a part of. So many walked with us and others joined as we passed them. The procession was filled with singing and praying.

                    Getting back in the car we headed north for the coast. We had no plans and no directions for anywhere we wanted to go. We just started driving and knew we&apos;d figure it out along the way. We found Mount Brandon along our route to the north but decided not to hike it mostly because we couldn&apos;t find anywhere to pull off and park.

                    Following the coast to the west for a while, we found the Wine Strand where we stopped for a picnic lunch and to just watch the waves crash in. After skipping rocks for longer than a grown man will admit, we continued west and began to look around and think the area looked familiar. At first, we thought Ireland was beginning to run together until we saw a sign welcoming us to Ballyferriter. We had somehow made it back to our home while we were wandering around Dingle. This beautiful peninsula had so much for us to explore and yet was also so much smaller than we expected.

                    Continuing west, we found a place to pull off the road near a beach to take a hike along the mini-cliffs. Our path took us through fields with cows and other fields with sheep. While admiring the view of the Three Sisters (3 coastal high points in a row) we were greeted by some locals who saw us staring at the Three Sisters and asked if we were trying to see the Star Wars set. We had no idea, but apparently the not yet released Star Wars: Episode VIII will have some scenes shot from this location and we were staring right at them. They told us that the actors were no longer there but before they left they went to go visit the local school. How cool is that? There was no real publicity about it and that&apos;s part of why it&apos;s so cool to me.

                    Making our way further up the coast we stopped at Waymont (according to Google Maps, though I never saw a sign), this point jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean was a great view of the harbour from the vista point. However, it wasn&apos;t until we decided to leave the vista and hike up onto the hill that the view became really great. These secluded views reminded us that the best and most rewarding views are so often found when you trek a little further than the designated vistas.

                    With the sun getting close to setting there was one place I wanted to find, Dunquin Harbour. Honestly, this was one of my favorite shots from all of Ireland. I had seen awesome shots from this little boat path leading to the harbour before going to Ireland and knew I needed to find it. I didn&apos;t realize how hard it would be to actually find though. We drove around for nearly an hour and had seen some incredible views off the coastal road and even found a place to pet cute, baby sheep but still hadn&apos;t found what we were looking for. (Quick side note, glad we didn&apos;t stop to pet the lambs. On the way back to the States while going through customs one of their questions was if we had come in contact with any farm animals.)

                    We were beginning to think the picture I saw wasn&apos;t really in Dunquin but was mislabeled as Dunquin. Just as we were ready to just give up, we decided to make a turn into a place we hadn&apos;t check yet but had passed 4-5 times. There it was! We couldn&apos;t believe it was real!

                    Last time, we had been defeated by clouds but were hopeful for our upcoming trip to the Skellig Islands. After a hearty, Irish breakfast we walked to the docks to catch our boat to the Skelligs. We were greeted by five or so captains all calling out names in very thick Irish accents looking for their passengers so they could be on their way. Asking a few of them for &quot;Eoin&quot; (which we had no idea how to pronounce at the time) yielded no results. Finally, one captain said, &quot;I know Eoin, he&apos;s over there.&quot; (pointing toward the end of the dock) We followed this captain as we thought he was taking us to him. After going to a boat and it not being Eoin, he turned to us and said &quot;Why are you following me? Eoin is over there.&quot;

                    Realizing that where he had actually pointed was to a single boat on the other side of the river, we panicked and immediately started hustling over the bridge to catch our boat. We arrived and were greeted by a man that looked like he was straight out of a novel about the Irish sea. He introduced himself as Eoin (pronounced essentially like Owen) and made a joke about us running across the bridge. He then explained that we can go inside the Skellig museum as we wait for the others. Turns out we didn&apos;t need to run...oh well, better safe than sorry.

                    We learned all about the Skellig Michael&apos;s incredible history. The rocky, dangerous island is about 7 miles off the coast of Portmagee and was occupied by Christian monks from sometime during the 6th century until late into the 12th century. Seeing what they built all the way out there is incredible, the island is as harsh and unforgiving as it gets. For something a little more current, it was on the Skellig Michael that <a href='https://youtu.be/eaxTllYqvls?t=190'>the last scene from Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a> was filmed.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Due to the danger of trying to land people on the island and the dangers on the island itself, they only allow the trip if the weather isn&apos;t too bad and the waves aren&apos;t too big. You need to book your trip far in advance as they only allow about 200 people a day to land on the island (many more circle the island to see it which is nice, but trust me, it is not remotely as epic) and then you need to hope for good weather. Thankfully, as was the case for our entire trip, the weather was gorgeous!

The island is home to over fifty thousand birds, so I&apos;m not sure you&apos;d want to visit the island. After looping around Little Skellig we made our way to the main event, Skellig Michael. If Eoin was a character in a book about the sea, this was the Irish version of Treasure Island. Rising out of the sea, you wondered how the monks made the trip out here let alone survived on the island.

                    Docking in a small cove, we disembarked from our boat and headed up the path. There were signs all over the place warning of falling rocks and to keep moving. This was a dangerous place, but well worth the risk. After a brief safety talk from one of the few people that stay on the island (for two months at a time, incredibly) to maintain it we began our climb.

                    The monks had laid/carved slate stairs spiraling up the side of the island. Higher and higher we climbed, the views getting increasingly more beautiful. We reached a small valley between the two peaks. On your left, was the tallest peak on the island. On your right, the stairs to the monastery and the second tallest peak. In front and behind you were sharp slopes down into the Atlantic Ocean.

                    We were lucky that we were one of the last boat trips so we were able to have our entire last hour on the island with just the ten people on the boat and the people working on the island. This gave us some incredible shots without people. You can see a great panorama I took from our valley lunch spot <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/Great+Skellig/@51.7707024,-10.541172,3a,75y,207.37h,98t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-pSY9jsTFc-o%2FV18w1Q9bJNI%2FAAAAAAAAYxE%2FAWdAGBzOpv85dAgUoZ52LaWWm8YIygMYwCLIB!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F-pSY9jsTFc-o%2FV18w1Q9bJNI%2FAAAAAAAAYxE%2FAWdAGBzOpv85dAgUoZ52LaWWm8YIygMYwCLIB%2Fw251-h100-n-k-no%2F!7i9728!8i3864!4m5!3m4!1s0x484fbc67fdc50715:0x9ac017e72720f9e0!8m2!3d51.7706615!4d-10.5405245'>here</a>.

                    Next to our lunch spot was the taller of the two peaks on the island. This peak is no longer accessible except by special permit as there is no safe way up. The monastery on the other peak housed about twelve men looking to seclude themselves from civilization to grow closer to God. This peak, however, was for those who wished to seclude themselves even more, the hermit.

                    Our entire time on the island birds flew all around us. My favorite, the puffin only makes an appearance a few months out of the year before heading out to sea. One look, and you&apos;ll fall in love with them.

                    After lunch, we made our way to the monastery on the shorter peak. Walking around we saw the where the monk lived, beehive huts made out of stone. These structures had no luxuries at all. I essentially had to crawl through the door to get in, so I can&apos;t imagine a big monk on this island.

                    As was par for the course in Ireland we didn&apos;t want to leave but knew we had to start heading down in order to catch our boat back. We were the last to leave the monastery and the valley. We wanted to soak every moment up that we could.

                    The wife and I both agree that the Skelligs were hands down the coolest thing we did in Ireland and that includes climbing the Croagh Patrick, visiting Dublin, and even the famous Cliffs of Moher. If you have the opportunity to land on the Skellig Michael, take it (just promise to bring me). It&apos;s truly unlike anything else I&apos;ve ever done.

                    Upon returning from the Skelligs, it was time to finish the Ring of Kerry and head on to the Dingle Peninsula. We waved goodbye to the quaint charm of Portmagee (yes we actually waived) and headed back on the Ring of Kerry toward Killarney. We weren&apos;t on it long before we saw the ruins of a castle that we knew we needed to explore.

                    The Ballycarbery Castle is just off the N70, the main road. The vine-covered castle ruins are worth the stop. If for nothing else, then so you can get a cool shot like mine. Even better though, you can actually climb up into the second and third stories of the castle and act as if you were the ruler of the land (c&apos;mon, you know you want to).

                    As our day grew short and began to stretch into evening, we made it to the Dingle Peninsula. I&apos;ll leave the stories of Dingle for next time. But before I go, I have to say something about our lodging. We stayed in <a href='https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3524768'>a house in Ballyferriter with an incredible view</a>. I highly recommend staying there for the night as Breege is the sweetest woman on Airbnb. She did everything to make our stay as wonderful and as welcoming as possible, including having a sign welcoming me to the house.

I don&apos;t receive any referral credit for you signing up for Airbnb from the earlier link I gave you taking you to her place. However, if you&apos;d like to help me get referral credit for providing the recommendation then please sign up for Airbnb via <a href='http://www.airbnb.com/c/jmckinney2'>this link</a>.

                    With morning came an end to our time in Kenmare, we were sad to leave this wonderful place that allowed us to see such an amazing views around Killarney National Park, the Gap of Dunloe, and the Ring of Beara. It was time to continue our sojourn through Ireland though.

                    Our next trek would take us to the tip of the Kerry Peninsula by way of the Ring of Kerry. While the majority of people drive the Ring of Kerry in one day, we decided to take two and stay the night in Portmagee. Heading out from Kenmare we headed along the coast. Since we had the time we would stop whenever we saw a sign directing us to an interesting sight or a pull-off that had an incredible view.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Our first major stop worth photographing was the Staigue Fort. This fort, built sometime between 300 to 400 AD, has walls that are multiple feet. Built in the valleys of hill country and with good sightlines down the hill to the bay, I can easily see why they built the fort where they did. It was a lot of fun climbing the walls and walking around the top of the walls. I&apos;m not sure if people were actually this short back then or if they were just more ok with ducking every time they entered a doorway, but I had to almost get on my hands and knees to make it into the fort.

                    After nearly knocking my head on almost every doorway in the fort and with me only a little bit woozy from that, we headed back to the car. Continuing our drive we decided to take the slightly longer route to the Ballinskelligs before heading to Portmagee. I&apos;m happy we did because our drive into Portmagee took us up on top of a high hill before heading down. This gave some great views of the quaint town that we would stay the night in. From right to left the land sloped from flat to the highest points in the area before dropping off dramatically as cliffs into the ocean. Off in the distance, the Valentia Island looked like you could hike the entire island in a day if you wanted and would be rewarded handsomely with incredible views.

                    Being in awe of the cliffs we knew we needed to check them out. They are the Cliffs of Kerry, and while they are less popular than the world famous Cliffs of Moher (for good reason as they are not as expansive as their County Clare cousins) they were still awe-inspiring. We hadn&apos;t seen any cliffs yet in Ireland so we just stood and stared for a long time at the painted cliffs before us. Off in the distance, we saw two islands rising out of the ocean. This brought a great deal of excitement because that would be tomorrow&apos;s destination, the Skellig Islands.

                    After checking into our B&B, we walked into the town to grab a bite to eat and a walk around the small fishing village. With winds whipping and us being right on the Atlantic, the temperature was definitely a little bit more chilly than our more inland destinations. We drove over to Valentia Island to catch the sunset before bed (sunset was at around 10 pm).

                    Having a big day ahead of us with an early wake up we wanted to get to bed as soon as possible...until...I learned that Portmagee is certified Dark Sky Reserve. For those of you who don&apos;t know what that means. Basically, Portmagee is an area, that is kept free of artificial light pollution. This means that some of the best star gazing on the planet can be had from this location. The moment I learned this from my friend Google, I jumped up, threw on some shoes and headed to the car to go to the beach nearby considered the darkest of the area. My dreams were then promptly thrashed upon walking outside, looking up, and seeing clouds...I was in one of the eleven certified Dark Sky Reserves on the planet and I couldn&apos;t take advantage of it!

                    As we drove from Kenmare through Moll&apos;s Gap this time we didn&apos;t take the right towards Killarney National Park. Instead, we headed left toward Lord Brandon&apos;s Cottage to leave our car for the day while we made the trek through the Gap of Dunloe. The road became a single lane for multiple miles. Thankfully, there were very few cars on it but with thick brush on both sides of the road, it made passing each other difficult. We missed multiple turns and got a little lost along the way but that&apos;s all part of the fun. Missing one turn took us to a serene lake, we definitely didn&apos;t mind that detour. After driving down what looked like someone&apos;s driveway we had finally found Lord Brandon&apos;s Cottage.

                    Online I had seen conflicting reports about whether you can drive the Gap of Dunloe or not. Some said it was ok just not advised due to the amount of horse-drawn carriages and hikers on the single lane road. Others said it was not legal to drive on the road. Regardless, we felt we didn&apos;t want to take the chance and would rather hike it anyway.

                    This was 100% the right call. While I didn&apos;t see any signs prohibiting cars and would often see cars on the road, they were more of a nuisance to the hikers due to how narrow the road is and the lack of a shoulder in my areas. Plus, you don&apos;t get to appreciate the views due to them going by so much more quickly. There are also some views that you don&apos;t get inside the car. If you are able to walk the long road, I highly recommend it.

We began following the path back we had driven in on before stopping to &#34;baaaaa&#34; at sheep we saw on the side of the road. Don&apos;t lie you would do it too.

                    If you look at the picture to the left to this paragraph, you&apos;ll see the path we took from Lord Brandon&apos;s. This led us through the small township you see. After you pass the township, you&apos;ll come to a fork in the road. The sign is a tad confusing because it shows a hiking symbol pointed to the left, that hiking symbol is for those hiking the Kerry Peninsula. You want to head right. I say this because I saw people go left and then have to come back. If not for some kind bicyclists fortuitously climbing the mountain at that moment we may have made that same mistake. Thankfully, they were able to direct us to the correct path, all while going up the steep incline on their bikes.

                    We had followed the road up, we had reached the highest point on our path. We could see the vast Black Valley we had just come from stretching out behind us and the incredible sights of the Gap of Dunloe ahead of us. Stopping for a snack and a brief rest we had a short conversation with a white haired couple that was also making the 13 mile trip from Lord Brandon&apos;s to Kate Kearney&apos;s and back. They told us about how they had done this hike before but it was when they were much younger. I must say I am still impressed that they were able to complete this hike at their age.

The path wound down and leveled off and became a leisurely stroll compared to the steep incline we had just came from. Sheep grazed on the side of the road and up on the mountains. They hopped effortlessly from rock to rock looking for that perfect blade of grass to chow down on.

                    Hiking back through the Gap was just as beautiful as it was the first time. The hike back was so much easier due to us being on the descent on that steep road. Before heading back to Kenmare we decided to see what was down the road right past the parking area we had left our car at outside of Lord Brandon&apos;s Cottage. This turned out to almost be a costly mistake. The road turned into a dirt and gravel path and offered no place turn around. We had to make a u-turn on a road no wider than our car with a lot of mud right off the path. Thankfully, we didn&apos;t get stuck. It was to be our last night in Kenmare, our home for the past few days. So, of course, we decided to reward ourselves for our big day of hiking with an ice cream from the local shoppe.

                    I enjoyed every minute of hiking the Gap of Dunloe and I hope that when you visit Ireland, you make it part of your trip as well. There are easier ways of seeing it if you&apos;re not one for hours of hiking in a day. I&apos;ve seen people online talk about taking a boat from Ross Castle in Killarney National Park to Lord Brandon&apos;s Cottage then hiking to Kate Kearney&apos;s, followed by a short taxi ride back to Ross Castle. Though you could easily reverse this if you&apos;d like to avoid going up the steep incline. The only thing you would need to do is make sure you make it to Lord Brandon&apos;s early enough to catch the last boat to Ross Castle. This seems like a unique experience and one I would like to experience when we go back to Ireland one day.

                    Strangely, I don&apos;t believe this is that well known of a hike for many people in Ireland unless they are from that area. I have a friend from the northern area of West Ireland living here in the States now. When he asked what we would doing on our trip to Ireland I listed off a few things including the Gap of Dunloe. He told me he was only familiar with it because his American wife had also hiked the Gap.

                    Kenmare, a lovely town of just over 2,000, would be our home for the next few days. It&apos;s strange how a town so small by US standards felt much bigger there. Kenmare and Killarney are considered the 2 jumping off point for exploring the famous Ring of Kerry. If you&apos;re looking for a peaceful time with a lot less tourist-y feel, Kenmare is your type of place. Killarney was fun and not a large city by any means, but it is definitely more of a tourist central area.

                    No matter which town you stay in, you need to drive the road between them to see one of the most amazing views in Ireland in my opinion. Moll&apos;s Gap is a mountainous intersection of roads. Our first day in Kenmare, we headed to the Killarney National Park and needed to drive through Moll&apos;s Gap to get there. As we trekked along the mountain roads there came a point where the road curved to the right seemingly right into the rocks. We made that right and instantly a &#34;wooooooooowwwww!&#34; came from both our lips in exclamation. To be fair, Ireland would do this over and over again throughout our adventures.

I love my wife, we both said when looking out at all of this, &#34;I can&apos;t wait to go hike this!&#34; Not wanting to miss any time hiking through one of only 6 National Parks in Ireland, we headed back to the car to drive those windy roads to Killarney town.

                    As windy as our drive along the Healy Pass was on the Beara Peninsula, the road to Killarney was far more so. This isn&apos;t a bad thing though, I thoroughly enjoyed driving the windy roads. Our little Hyundai was right at home along these windy roads to Killarney, but it was the tour buses (they&apos;re a recurring enemy of mine on this trip) that would make this road feel so much more difficult to drive on at times. But we had arrived. We had made it to Killarney National Park and it was awesome. The Emerald Isle was on full display here, the various shades of green shimmering in the sunlight.

                    Starting up the steep path through the woods we didn&apos;t make it far before we had to stop. Not from exhaustion but because we found a waterfall! I don&apos;t know about you but I&apos;m a sucker for waterfalls. Something about them is always cool to me. The rushing water creates a peaceful and relaxing noise that washes away all my worries. Though, while I&apos;m in Ireland, what worries do I have?

                    Many people made the short trip to the waterfall but few went further and climbing up the steep path to continue the hike and that&apos;s a shame. They missed some wonderful hiking to the top of the waterfall and views that you can&apos;t get from down in the parking lot. Maybe that&apos;s just me though, I have always been one to push that little bit further, knowing it almost always pays off. The views you get from vistas are great, but the best views are the ones you have to work to get to.

                    Eschewing the jaunting cars (horse-drawn carriages) that were rather pushy about getting us to hire them, we made our way to the Muckross House and Gardens. Situated on Muckross Lake and in the middle of Killarney National Park, this mansion is well worth the visit. Though, we were both expecting a mansion with grandeur similar to that of the Biltmore, this estate is far less expansive. However, the perfectly manicured grounds and gardens (which are free to visit) make this a place well worth the visit.

                    Leaving Muckross, we made our way to Killarney, which is a lot of fun to say in your best Irish brogue. Just don&apos;t do so around someone actually from Ireland...can&apos;t imagine you&apos;re good enough at it to pull it off. Walking around Killarney we stopped in little shops and even went into some of the tourist-y shops. After dinner, we decided to treat ourselves to a pastry from French pastry shop knowing that tomorrow we would be hiking about 13 miles in the Gap of Dunloe.

                    One thing we were surprised at while visiting the National Parks though was the lack of trails. At both Killarney and Connemara later there was very trails. At Connemara especially, there was only one trail that was broken up into three different loops.

                    From Kinsale, we headed toward the West Coast to drive along the Beara Peninsula on the Ring of Beara. The lesser known cousin to the Ring of Kerry, the Ring of Beara doesn&apos;t see nearly as many tourists. I&apos;m not sure why because I thought it was actually more beautiful than the Ring of Kerry. With fewer cars (and buses) to clog up the roadways, we enjoyed unabated views of this national treasure. Just goes to show, that sometimes the best places aren&apos;t on the beaten path.

                    On the Ring of Beara is where we first experienced sheep walking on and around the road. They were everywhere. All with different color spray paint on them, I assume to designate who they belong to. As we drove the windy roads along Beara, we cut through the Peninsula by driving along the Healy Pass, which offered views of wide-open plains rising into high hills.  Upon seeing a pull-off near the top of the pass, we decided to go hillwalking.

                    Each time we reached a new vista, we had to just stop and stare. Ireland is truly one of the most beautiful places I&apos;ve ever been. There is something enchanting about Ireland. From the top of the hill, we could see a few houses around a beautiful lake at the bottom of the valley. We sat at the top of that hill for over half an hour just taking in the view and thanking God for an incredible landscape.

                    Derreen Gardens is full of lush growth and fragrant flowers. A peaceful walk around the grounds made us feel as though we were in another time, one less concerned with the latest phone or who liked what on Facebook. We saw older couples taking walks and families having picnics by the water. Our own tranquil stroll through the gardens included plenty of time to stop and take it all in.

We had a wonderful night walking around the streets looking for shops that bear our surname. It was in Kenmare, that we got our first experience with Irish supermarkets.

                    It only took the entire summer for me to finally write about our trip to Ireland. As our flight took off from Orlando in mid-May, I knew we would be embarking on a truly once in a lifetime trip. After a short connection in Boston, we departed for Shannon! I had never been to Ireland but I knew I was excited to go and I knew I would love it. Boy was I right, it was hard to leave such a breathtakingly beautiful country. My grandmother had come to America from Ireland when she was a little girl. Being in a place that only 2 generations before had been my family&apos;s home made me immediately feel at home there. Not to mention that I definitely could pass for an Irish citizen, well at least until I spoke obviously.

                    It&apos;s been a long time since I was as tired as I was that first day. The flight was overnight and I slept for at most 45 mins. Never really been able to sleep on planes (or in cars for that matter). Thankfully, I was at least comfortable, as I had sprung the extra cash for a bulkhead seat. I am 6&apos; 4&quot; so that extra legroom was a lifesaver. As we got into our rental car, I sat in the driver&apos;s seat and immediately just felt odd. I was sitting on the opposite side of the car from my everyday driving. Changing gears, grabbing my water bottle, and even holding my wife&apos;s hand was now my left hand&apos;s responsibility. For the most part, we were fine driving on the left side of the road, though we did have one close call when I had to make a right turn while going around a bend in a busy town with tour buses all around me.

                    Oh those wretched tour buses. The smallest of them take up the entire lane and most venture into your lane. I honestly felt bad for the people in them, they wouldn&apos;t experience Ireland the way my wife and I did. They couldn&apos;t take a detour, change their plans last minute, or just stop on the side of the road to hike. They missed some of the most amazing sights that we experienced.

                    Our first major stop was to experience that great liquid gold, Irish whiskey. We headed south from Shannon to Middleton, the home of the Jameson Distillery. What a blast that was. I learned so much and got to drink some delicious whiskey doing it. At the end of the tour, I participated in a taste test with Jameson 12 yr, Jonnie Walker Black, and Jack Daniels. Somehow, I feel they didn&apos;t exactly go for top-shelf when it came to bourbon.

Our first (but not last) Irish poured Guinness was ordered in a pub in Kinsale. We felt a bit like zombies that first day except without wanting to eat braaaaaainnnssss. I had gotten less than an hour of sleep in 40 hours. Needless to say, I was very excited when that first day&apos;s rest came. I was out as soon as my head hit the pillow.

We stayed at the <a href='http://dresserpalmerhouse.com/'>Dresser Palmer House</a> right near <a href='http://visithistoricsavannah.com/forsyth-park/'>Forsyth Park</a>.

                    Saturday we headed out to the <a href='http://www.gastateparks.org/Wormsloe'>Wormsloe Historic Site</a> (unfortunate name if you ask me) which is the colonial estate of Noble Jones (awesome name). Wormsloe has the most amazing drive, a canopy of live oaks and Spanish moss creating a drive like no other. The drive was incredible and I was able to capture it on the GoPro with time lapse. After driving in, there are some trails you can take, as well as tours of the historic recreations of the village led by rangers. These historic recreations include a blacksmith shop and a small house. Wormsloe was certainly something worth checking out at least once.

                    After Wormsloe, we made the short drive to Skidaway Island State Park. This state park had a nice trail leading out to a river. On the banks of the river, we stood just enjoying the silence of nature. Such a peaceful moment with the water softly flowing by and lapping up onto the riverbank. Heading back into the city, Saturday evening was spent walking around the city, people watching from a bench in one of the parks, and of course going to the giant candy shop on River Street. We attended the vigil Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral as well which is a beautiful church and a definite must see.

                    Sunday at the B&B we had delicious peaches and cream french toast which I&apos;m still dreaming about. Before leaving Savannah we went to <a href='https://www.nps.gov/fopu/index.htmFort'>Fort Pulaski</a>, which ended up being the highlight of our trip. This 19th Century fort is on the way to Tybee Island and is a National Monument. You can read the full write-up I did of Fort Pulaski for the sports/outdoor blog website, Sportody, <a href='http://www.sportody.com/blog/must-do-historical-sites-near-savannah-fort-pulaski'>here</a>. However, the gist of the experience was that there were tons of cannons (always a favorite of mine), we played 19th Century baseball (I got a double), and the fort was awesome! Basically, you need to go to Savannah immediately!

                    I invite you to try an exercise with me. Close your eyes and picture a place you&apos;ve always wanted to go. Picture what this place looks like. Is it a majestic mountain, a waterfall crashing upon the rocks below, or a city in some distant land? Next, think of what this place would smell like. Do hints of primrose and pine fill the air? Maybe it&apos;s homemade Italian pasta and a bottle of old wine that saturate your senses. Lastly, what do you hear? Is French music playing? How about birds singing their happy songs as they go about their day? Or maybe the only sound for miles is your footsteps and the wind. Go ahead, close your eyes now, I&apos;ll wait.

                    I hope your day already has a large amount of adventure. I hope it doesn&apos;t seem to drag on from one day to the next. I hope it doesn&apos;t consist of you waking up, sitting at a desk constantly checking the clock, sitting in traffic, and finally crawling into bed all to do it over again the next day. However, if it does then it&apos;s time to get out there and change that. First, you probably want to find a different job, one that fulfills you more. Second, it&apos;s time for you to get out and experience the great adventure that is life.

                    I&apos;m not saying you should quit your job and travel the world until you&apos;re flat broke. We all have responsibilities to family and you need to have money in order to travel. However, that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t still do the things we want to do and go to the places we&apos;ve always wanted to see. I believe we find ways to fund and find time for the things we make a true priority in our lives.

                    What&apos;s holding you back from getting out there? Do you feel like you can&apos;t get away from the office? I understand that feeling. It&apos;s very common to feel like you can&apos;t leave due to fears of how your clients or colleagues could focus without you there. The truth is, though, they&apos;ll get along just fine without you. I know that can make some people sad or feel unimportant. I don&apos;t mean to get you down. I tell you that to free you from putting so much stock in your job that you forget to ever truly live.

                    Is money the issue that&apos;s keeping you from traveling? If so, I have a couple recommendations for you. First, set up a dedicated travel account. Then, set up automatic transfers to that travel account. Next step, don&apos;t look at the balance very often and you&apos;ll be amazed at quickly the money accumulates. Another tip, would be to cut out things that are less important than traveling to you and then take the money you&apos;ve saved and put it in the account. Go out to eat all the time? Cook more at home. Drink Starbucks every day? Brew your own coffee. Cable is expensive and if you really want to watch TV, the <a href='http://www.gomohu.com/'>Mohu</a> Leaf and <a href='http://www.hulu.com/'>Hulu</a> are much more affordable options.

I think 3 of the 5 are especially poignant. &#34;I wish I&apos;d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&#34;, &#34;I wish I hadn&apos;t worked so hard.&#34;, and &#34;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&#34.

                    I love the mountains, nothing else causes me to say &#34;wow!&#34;, &#34;woah!&#34;, and &#34;that&apos;s beautiful!&#34; so often...other than when I&apos;m with my wife, of course. This was our final full day and we spent it exploring the Blue Ridge Parkway, an amazing way to finish up the trip. As we drove down the winding roads, we found ourselves constantly wanting to pull over to take pictures, each vista seemingly more beautiful than the last. The best stop we made was at Waterrock Knob.

                    An awe-inspiring place, Waterrock Knob boasts one of the highest peaks along the Blue Ridge. The parking lot has incredible views for sure, allowing you to see above the whole horizon. The best views are at the top of the trail of the peak at the back of the parking lot. We set out on the walking path that turned into a trail shortly. Most of the leaves on the trees along the trail had already fallen due to the high altitude. This ended up being a blessing as it allowed us to see the incredible views along the hike without being obstructed. The peak offered even better views and was well worth the effort it took to climb. The most interesting thing was seeing the road winding through the mountains. From our vantage, cars resembled toys and people were mere ants.

                    We continued the winding road through the mountains. I love driving these type of roads, they&apos;re just plain fun and when you add the fall foliage it&apos;s even better. The trailhead of our next hike had a picnic table and we used the opportunity to have a surface to eat on. The weather had gotten windy and cold due to the altitude so it wasn&apos;t as pleasant as we had hoped when we initially packed our picnic lunch. As we looked up from our table to the cliff high above us, I noticed some people on top of it. I remember thinking how high up they were and that it was going to hurt to make that climb.

                    The trail was steep but paved for the beginning, definitely a good thigh workout! Hiking is one of those things that&apos;s always worth it when you reach your destination, no matter how painful it was at the time. This was no exception. Knowing the hike ends with a waterfall or a mountain summit always help me push further than I think I can at the bottom. Saying this makes me realize I&apos;m essentially a donkey chasing after a carrot.

                    The trees along the trail were dense, which made the point where it finally opened up at the summit, even more, amazing. The view seemed to stretch on forever. I can still see the mountain peaks in the distance rising above the valleys. Various collections of oranges, reds, yellows, greens, and browns littered the horizon. Some areas looked like a fire was ablaze on the mountain, while other areas almost glowed with their golden leaves.

For any guys out there debating whether or not to don the crumb catcher, I recommend giving it a try. It&apos;s an exercise in patience to make it past the itching and ridicule you&apos;ll undoubtedly receive the first week or so (well unless you&apos;re a Greek man whose facial grows at an unnatural rate, you know who you are).

                    This is my long overdue post about our trip to North Carolina. I tell ya, sometimes it&apos;s way too easy to let things get away from you. I think my New Years resolution is to write these while I&apos;m on the trip, that and to make blogging a much more regular thing. Expect to see a new blog post every other Monday afternoon. Ya, I think that&apos;s a good goal to have, not too overwhelming right? Better than buying a gym membership that doesn&apos;t get used after the first few weeks of the year. Definitely never done that before... We&apos;ll see how this goes. Wish me luck I guess?

The last week of October, my wife and I, joined by another married couple friend of ours loaded up the car and headed north for a trip to see the Fall foliage. This has become an annual trip for me over the past few years with friends but now as a newly married man, I was able to make it a couples weekend.

                    It turns out we came at the perfect time for our multi-day trip. The leaves were amazing! They had only started to change at the elevation our cabin was at. The picture above is from our back patio of the cabin. No camping for me this time, our friends and my wife prefer the comforts a cabin provide. Anyway, the trees just outside cabin started as mostly yellow and by the end of our trip were a conglomeration of yellow, orange, and red. It always amazes me how beautiful it is to look at trees.

                    Our first day trip for hiking was to the beautiful Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nestled between Cherokee, NC and Gatlinburg, TN (two rather touristy towns) is this gorgeous piece of protected national land. It was a place I had road tripped to the past couple years with friends, but this was a different experience than previous trips. The Sun was out most of the day and it was on the warmer side that day so our climb up the Chimney Tops was actually painful on the hands. You can see the rocks that we climbed in the picture to the right. The rocks burned our hands as we ascended, but boy is that view ever worth it.

                    After burning our hands, we headed down the mountain and headed to our next destination, a waterfall not far from our cabin. Not sure why but I always love sticking my head under waterfalls (especially when the water is ice cold). It certainly was cold, but well worth the dunk. That night was spent relaxing in the hot tub at the cabin. After a long day of hiking, it was exactly what we needed.

                    The next day was a day off from hiking. In the morning, we headed over to Hendersonville to Grandad&apos;s Apple Farm. Surprisingly warm out and definitely late in the season our dreams of picking an apple straight from the tree were kind of dashed. I was able to find one good apple to pluck, but it took longer than we&apos;d like to admit to find that good one. While there we had a nice picnic lunch and made sure to grab some delicious apple snacks to go with our food. If you go there I highly recommend the apple cider smoothie and the apple dumpling a la mode, quite delicious.

Reminding me slightly of the vineyards I toured in Napa Valley, though those were a good bit larger. It was well worth the trip especially because it was right down the road from Grandad&apos;s Farm. We had a tour of the vineyards and received lots of great info on how they make the wine. It was a tranquil and quaint place, I think just relaxing on the rocking chairs was my favorite part. Although a close second was the wine tasting.

However, even if you aren&apos;t afraid of heights you may still feel woozy if you happen to look through the slits in the air grate on the floor.

                    We reached the peak of 10,000 feet, got off the gondola, and almost kissed the ground (kidding). We stopped by High Finance for a drink and sat out on the deck to enjoy the view with the beer. It was an amazing view, we saw mountains littering the landscape. Below, the city of Albuquerque sprawled out before us and all of it looked so tiny.

It&apos;s one of the things I love most about going out into nature. Far away from the bustling of our daily lives, you are able to see what is truly important. The silence you find in the great outdoors relaxes you, if it&apos;s been awhile since you last experienced it, get out! Go! Have an adventure!

                    After eating lunch at Jemez Falls and checking out the Valles Caldera we headed over to the Bandelier National Monument near Los Alamos. As we rolled in, so did the storms. We were worried this would keep us from getting to see this interesting piece of history. The Rangers, informed us that the storms looked like they would be staying up on the plateau and the canyon should be fine. We waited a few minutes and then headed out in the light rain.

                    Thankfully, after a few more minutes, the rain subsided. After a short stroll, slightly damp, we arrived at the monument. It was definitely an impressive sight. We saw the cave dwellings, built into the side of the canyon walls. Below, there was remnants of a rather large village.

                    We walked along the nicely laid out steps, with railings up to the entrance of the first dwelling that we could enter via ladder. There was already someone in that one and a family with two small children waiting to get in. We decided that we would just skip this one and enter the next one. Following the path a little further along we saw a few <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph'>petroglyphs</a> on the walls inside and outside the dwellings.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    There were clearly multiple &#34;floors&#34; of dwellings, as well as having multi-level houses down below. We came across the next ladder and climbed up, as a tall person I can say that I would not have fared well in those back then. In reading the guide from the ranger station, the average male was 5 foot 6 and the average female was 5 foot. I&apos;m not sure how someone even that size could stay in those very long. I was hunched over my entire time in the dwelling.

                    We exited that dwelling and moved along to the last dwelling that you could enter in that area, I enjoyed this one much more. It was tall enough for me to stand upright and move around. I could definitely enjoy an amazing night&apos;s sleep in that dark cave.

                    In reading the guide book more to find out about this interesting people, I learned that life was difficult and the average lifespan was only 35 years. So maybe my dark cave would not have provided me that good night&apos;s sleep after all, at least not back then. It&apos;s always important to remember how good we have it in this day and age. I enjoyed my experience learning more about the people who once inhabited the walls of the Frijoles Canyon.

                    This was the most diverse day of the trip. We headed out from the Sandia foothills near Albuquerque and made our way to the red rock deserts on the way to the Soda Dam near Jemez Springs. The red rock deserts were beautiful, a vibrant red like I had never seen. It felt like I was on Mars. From there we headed to the Soda Dam.

                    The Soda Dam, an interesting sight to say the least, is a dam formed by the collection of minerals. It looked a lot like something out of a science fiction movie. It was definitely not your typical waterfall, but was worth the stop on our way. After that brief stop, we followed the road into the mountains. We winded our way through the sprawling pine tree lined paths.

                    We stopped for lunch at Jemez Falls, it reminded me of pictures of Colorado. I&apos;m partial to the green mountain landscapes like these over the brown ones, like the Sandia Mountains. It was beautiful, we spent a great deal of time exploring here. We climbed on rocks, sat near the edges of cliffs, and skipped rocks on the river. Eventually, however, we did have to leave.

                    From there we drove toward Bandelier National Monument. We came around a bend and were compelled to stop. There were these incredible plains with mountains surrounding them. A long time ago, a super volcano stood where the Valles Caldera stands. The Valles was formed by this super volcano collapsing.

                    We stood and stared at the immense beauty of the sight. I learned from locals later that evening that elk typically roam the Valles. Sadly, we didn&apos;t see any elk while we were there. It was hard to believe that in one day we had seen so much. New Mexico had certainly not disappointed and we weren&apos;t even done for the day.

                    Finally, we left the beautiful plains of the Valles and made our way to Bandelier. It was difficult to understand just how big the Valles is. As we were driving around the perimeter we looked down and had few things to judge the size against. Then, we saw a SUV driving on one of the roads in the middle. It looked much smaller than we felt it should. After research into the Valles, we learned that it is almost 14 miles wide.

                    We stayed in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains on historic Route 66. It was my first time on Route 66, unfortunately, we didn&apos;t spend much time exploring it. We did play the classic Chuck Berry song while on it though. It&apos;s amazing the wildlife that grows regardless of climate. Every time we left the house we saw rabbits and while leaving the house one evening we even got to see a bobcat. I was thankful to be in a house that was surrounded by so much nature.

                    There were a number of beautiful trails into the foothills near our house. One evening, my wife and I ventured out onto one before dinner. We began down the path and came upon a couple of large boulders stacked on top of each other. We, of course, climbed them. After taking a couple goofy pictures, we climbed down and continued on our path.

                    We came to a fork in the path and opted to take the more rugged, primitive trail. We followed it along and made a few wrong turns here and there trying to stay on the path. Finally after walking on that path a good ways, we decided we didn&apos;t think it was prudent to continue on the trail. There were too many points that we could easily lose the trail on the way back. So we headed back before we got ourselves lost.

                    We came back to that fork and headed onto the other trail that is much more defined. Though even this trail had plenty of cacti protruding into the trail. You had to be watchful of where you stepped in some areas. At one point the road sloped downward pushing me to speed up my walk. At the bottom there to greet me was a cacti about chest high. Thankfully, I stopped prior to getting stuck.

                    As we walked up to the entrance, the canyon walls felt more and more ominous. We traversed through narrow points where the canyon floor was smaller than the width of my shoes. At one point, we had to crouch walk under a boulder easily large enough to squash us. Thankfully, it was firmly wedged between the canyon walls. We twisted and turned our way and finally came to a point where the trail turned toward the top of the canyon.

We climbed the makeshift rock stairs. I kept thinking, what was the first person to do this thinking. There were points that would certainly have been extremely difficult if not for the railroad ties added to the trail to help create better steps.

                    We climbed higher and higher, each time we turned around we were rewarded with an increasingly beautiful view. We turned around and saw the iconic tent rock formations this site is known for. We ascended more of the path and turned around again, this time seeing more of the canyon, more of the tent rocks, and this time mountains off in the distance. Now I knew there was something truly worth it to climb to the top for. I pushed harder and hiked faster, I wanted to see the vista at the peak.

The view compelled us to be speechless (which if you&apos;ve ever met me is not my natural state).

                    This was my first trip to the American Southwest for a hiking trip. I have to admit, I was not expecting it to be nearly as beautiful as it was.

As we ventured out into the wilderness, the true beauty of the state became apparent. We saw red rock deserts, pine tree covered mountains, Native American cave dwellings, the Rio Grande, white limestone mountains, and plains resembling those in Wyoming. I was amazed that on one particular driving day, we saw most of that list in just a few hours.

                    The climate was also comfortable, this being August and the weather, while warm, was nothing compared to Florida&apos;s 90&apos;s and humid summer days. Personally, I&apos;m just more partial to hiking in cooler weather and like to save my multi-hour hikes for the cooler months.

                    Overall I was very impressed with the New Mexico. I always love diverse landscapes. Mountains are majestic to me, most likely due to the fact that the highest natural point in Florida is Britton Hill. This hill is a towering 312 feet. Even foothills are wonderful to someone who grew up 50 feet or less above sea level. I think my next trip to the Southwest will be to finally check out the Big Five in Utah or to see the Grand Canyon from up close, as opposed to just flying over it.

                  <br />
                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    We blew up the kiddie pools, laid out the plastic sheets, and put water and soap on everything. It was a high-scoring affair, I believe one game was around 19-17 and the other shorter game was 16-8. The score was obviously less important than the fun (though my team won both games...just saying). We made the rules up as we went. Cutting outs from 3 to an inning to 2, requiring slides at every base (even on a home run), and deciding whether you could steal bases or not halfway through the game. It felt a lot like when you&apos;re young, creating games with the neighborhood kids. It was a blast.

                  <br />
                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    There were mishaps for sure, people knocking over the pools (due to the sheer speed a slip &apos;n slide launches you), slipping in the outfield, and kicks that somehow went backwards. For example: we, being adults now (sort of), were a little weary of our initial slide. However, after you learn the oh so important, NEVER SLIDE ON YOUR STOMACH AS AN ADULT, you&apos;re fine.

                  <br />
                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    About 30 mins into the game, it started to pour, it was great! Our sliding went further and the mistakes increased greatly, all increasing the laughter. There are few activities where you hope it will rain on you, this is one.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Following the game, we spent time just running between each of the bases sliding. I haven&apos;t felt that much like a kid in a long time. It was a great feeling, one I plan to try and recreate this coming weekend when we play slip &apos;n slide kickball. Let the good times roll...or slide in this case.

                    A few years ago, I was walking to class and got caught in a torrential downpour. I had an important project in my backpack as well as my laptop. I sprinted into the nearest building and waited out the storm. Thankfully, my project wasn&#39t ruined and my laptop was ok. However, the experience was enough for me to spend money to ensure the safety of my belongings.

                    I went home, got on Amazon, and bought a waterproof backpack from Overboard. Now, almost 4 years later, it&#39s still my go to backpack. I ride my bike to work a large amount of the time. It is not uncommon to get stuck in a downpour and my Overboard pack protects my belongings. What does this have to do with camping deep in the woods?

                    Well, the Overboard pack is still my choice of backpack, even when hiking. I know that it doesn&#39t have the internal frame that traditional packs have and doesn&#39t have all the bells and whistles that other packs have. For me though, it&#39s exactly what I need.

                    When I&#39m out hiking in the woods, the last thing I want to think about is if my sleeping bag, tent, and clothes are going to get soaked if a thunderstorm rolls in. I know they have rain covers for regular packs but why buy something extra on top of an already expensive pack?

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    I know that other packs are made of lighter weight materials but it&#39s not like my bag is heavy, at just about 3 lbs. For far less than a typical pack I get IP66 protection and while that means it&#39s not completely waterproof it performs more than satisfactory. It has a pocket on each side as well as an internal pocket and has various loops to clip items to it on the outside. I am always looking for an upgraded pack that is extremely light and waterproof at the same time, but I rarely find any that offer what I&#39m looking for. If they do, they are often quite expensive and don&#39t offer a large enough improvement to justify the cost.

                    For awhile, I really wanted the 35L Sea to Summit Hydraulic Pack. I thought it would be my new go to pack. It has 5L more than my current pack and is completely waterproof. There was a great sale so I picked it up. I tried packing all the things I had packed in my 30L pack and found it to be more difficult. Maybe it&#39s the way space is used in the Sea to Summit versus the Overboard. Possibly it was because of the difference in shape, the rectangular Overboard versus the cylindrical Sea to Summit. I&#39m not sure why it didn&#39t fit as much. This was the bag I had wanted for a few months and when I got it I was disappointed. So for now I will continue to use my Overboard pack.

                    The Sawyer Mini is worth every bit of the $20 I spent on it. It&#39s lightweight, portable, and doesn&#39t take up a lot of room in your pack. I remember seeing the LifeStraw and thinking, while it&#39s a great idea for emergency situations it seems very limited. You would have to lean down near the water and sip from the stream. You have no way of transferring water to a water bottle for later drinking.

                    I suppose you could fill your bottles and sip from them, but this seems ineffective as now your bottles are contaminated. The other option, is water filtration tablets. I&#39ve tried these before and while they&#39re effective, they can leave the water tasting...less than ideal.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Then there is the Sawyer Mini. The compact water filtration system that cleans water effectively and doesn&#39t leave the water tasting terrible. It comes with a foldable water pouch so you can collect water from the stream.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    From there you screw on the Sawyer and either squeeze the water out of the pouch into your water bottle or you can drink it from the Sawyer. Another benefit of the Sawyer is it can be attached inline to a Camelbak. I haven&#39t personally done this, because I don&#39t have a Camelbak but it is fairly straightforward to do from what I&#39ve seen online.

                    The Sawyer being the right choice for me became cemented the first time I used it while on a weekend hike in the mountains of Georgia. I was extremely thirsty and instead of having to lean down near the stream and drink while holding myself up from not falling in the stream. I was able to simply lean down fill up a water pouch and drink. It was a simple affair, it left me impressed with the Sawyer.

                    Having clean drinking water while camping is paramount, and to do so without adding extra weight is especially useful. Water is adds a large amount of weight to your pack but an obvious necessity.

                    Having a way to not have to cut down on the amount you will need to carry without having to boil the water to make it safe is always worth the cost. At around $20 it&#39s not a painful cost for a large benefit. The Sawyer is my go to for having filtered water on my hikes. Stay hydrated, not thirsty my friends.

                    This past weekend, a friend and I headed up to the Cohutta Mountains in Northwest Georgia to hike the Cohutta Mountain Loop. It was absolutely gorgeous out there. We parked at the Three Forks Trailhead and headed out on the East Cowpen trail. My friend had a running watch to measure our distance traveled as well as elevation changes throughout the trip. We started at an elevation of 3,200 ft. and began to descend into the Cohutta Wilderness.

                    What we didn&#39t know when we started off on the trail was the lack of water that would be available on the trail we took. I had read some reviews of the area and some stories from the specific loop we were planning on doing and all the pictures were of people down by a river. What I didn&#39t realize was that the first time we&#39d see a river on the trail we took in would be when we got to the Jacks River after hiking just under 8 miles and dropping 2,000 ft. in elevation.

                    We had some water but I drink a lot and when we got down to the river after those 8 miles, I drank 4 bottles of water immediately and then another 4 when I got to camp. We used the Sawyer Mini for water filtration. It is definitely one of the best purchases I&#39ve ever made, it&#39s ultra portable and cleans the water effectively.

                    We then had to wade our way through the stream a couple of times to get to an open area to make camp. Slipping my feet into the cold water stream water after a good day of hiking was one of the more refreshing feelings I&#39ve had. The area we found was right on the river bank, just far enough back to have dry, solid ground but still right on the river. We set up the camp, started a fire, and ate dinner. It was so peaceful out there. The sound of the river lulled me to sleep, well that is until 5 mins after closing my eyes when nature called. All that water I guzzled to get rehydrated was ready to be set free. I must have woken up 4-5 times that night.

                    The next morning, we packed up camp and headed down to see the Jack&#39s River Falls. The hike down to the Falls was great. As we weaved our way around the river down we started to hear the thundering sound of a waterfall. The falls were beautiful, we just stopped and stared at them for awhile, neither of us wanting to move on. We pushed further to try and get different views of the natural beauty that was before us. After having our fill, who am I kidding I could still be there staring at them, we headed out on the trail back toward our car. We were at an elevation of 1,200 ft. now and were dreading the climb back.

                    The trail back was definitely painful, 2,000 ft. increase in 8 miles. We would boo out loud whenever the trail dropped in elevation for more than a few steps knowing that we would have to climb it again. The most frustrating thing was not the elevation increases, but that we thought there would be water on this trail. We quickly realized we were wrong and we would need to conserve water as we watched the trail we were on and the river part ways. We did stop for lunch at an area that clearly fed into the river, however, it had been dried up to mostly mud at this time of year.

                    If I was to do another hike in this area, which I would definitely not be opposed to, I would take the Jack&#39s River Trail the whole way. The lack of water on the trail we took was definitely a detriment to us staying an extra night out there. If we were take a trail that stayed on or close to the river the whole way we definitely would have stayed longer. Oh well, you live and you learn right? All in all we descended 2,000 ft. and ascended that same amount, as well as hiking a total of 20 miles. Definitely not a bad way to spend a Memorial Day weekend.

We stuck to the short nature trails around the campground and the swimming area. While on our short hike, we snapped some shots of a few turtles sunbathing. It was a lazy Saturday for us and for all of nature. We made our way to the springs for a dip in the chilly spring waters. It felt amazing once we got in, but boy that initial descent into the water is painful.

                    After a late lunch and a game of bocce ball, we headed back to the springs for swimming round 2. The heat had subsided a good bit and that made the jump back into the water that much more freezing. We spent the afternoon relaxing, jumping off the platform into the water, and racing each other in the water. It was a wonderful day to get away from not only the heat but the city as well. Our evening was spent playing card games, sitting around the fire, and chatting.

                    Sunday, my wife and I took another short hike in the morning and even got to see a deer 10 ft ahead of us before it scurried into the woods. I love relaxing weekends like these. The fresh air and sunny skies are exactly what I need. Out in the peace and quiet you can gather your thoughts and let go of the things that seem so important in your daily life. I think that&#39s the real beauty of the outdoors, they allow you to forget what you deem important and focus on what truly is: your friends, family, and of course having a little fun.

                    There are so many fixed blade knives out there. I know there are as many opinions about which knife is best than there is knives in the world. However, in my opinion I think the one that makes the most sense for the money is the Schrade SCHF26. I wanted something that was quality and would last but wouldn&#39t break the bank. At only $34 on Amazon, the price is excellent and the quality is wonderful as well.

                    All the knives I looked into were full-tang. I did a large amount of looking around before deciding upon the SCHF26. I originally thought I would go with the KA-BAR US Marine Corp, the Ontario 499 Air Force, or the SOG Seal Pup Elite. All are great knives, however, when I held them in my hand they just didn&#39t find feel quite right. I have large hands, so it is important to me to have a handle that is long enough. The KA-BAR and the Seal Pup just felt a little short in my hand for comfort. The Ontario had similar specs as the KA-BAR but was difficult to find locally so I ended up passing on it.

                    After passing on those, I began a new search. My new selections brought me to the KA-BAR BK-22 and the Schrade SCHF9. I thought I would go with the BK-22, I had it in my shopping cart and everything. It was an excellent knife, highly rated, and not a bad price at about $80 on Amazon. The BK-22 has a thick spine at a quarter inch and can take a beating. It&#39s made from 1095 Cro-Van steel Solid. I was about to purchase it, when someone suggested I look at the SCHF26. As I looked into it I began to like it more and more. I watched videos and articles comparing the BK-22 and the SCHF26 and most people agreed that the SCHF26 is just a better value.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    I pulled the trigger and ordered the SCHF26. I love it. The grip has a rubbery feel, it feels like it wouldn&#39t slip out of my hand even if I was doing something in the rain. It has a spine that is a quarter inch thick and flat. It has a sharp point and is a single edge blade. The weight distribution just felt right in my hands. It was a length I liked by staying just under 11&#34 and had a large handle at 5.4&#34. I&#39m very happy with my purchase, needless to say.

                    For selecting your own knife, there are many that will work. I was splitting hairs comparing many knives, many of which I didn&#39t list. People get very opinionated about which knife is best, and that&#39s fine, we are all passionate about different things. I just think that as long as it is a knife that is full-tang, the right size, the right shape, and made of a good material you will be fine. Often, picking a knife is best done by placing it in your hand and determining if it passes the initial gut test. Good luck picking out a knife and if you have questions or comments, feel free to leave them below!

                    My wife and I packed up Tuesday night and headed to a beach house a few hours from home, our stuff loaded up in the car and bikes secured on the trunk bike rack. I say secured but what I mean is we thought they were secured. I learned two valuable lessons this past Tuesday, don&#39t skimp on a bike rack and make sure you&#39ve double and triple checked that you&#39ve installed it correctly. We were in such a hurry and it was the first time we had used our bike rack that I didn&#39t place the side straps in the position they needed to be. It was probably not best to try a new bike rack out for the first time on a multi-hour interstate trip...I guess I learned three valuable lessons then.

                    We were on the interstate for 30 mins and everything seemed to be fine, I had been keeping a constant eye on the bikes to make sure they weren&#39t wobbling. Then not more than a minute later, we drove over a dip in the road. It was enough of a bounce to cause the lower bar to swing closed and caused the bikes to swing down toward the road. I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and inspected the bikes. Thankfully the only damage was that on my wife&#39s new bike (when I say new I mean one day old) the front tire had dragged on the asphalt and burned a hole in the tire and tube. It definitely could&#39ve been worse. We reattached the bikes and drove back the 30 mins home, put the bikes inside and headed out again. That was all the excitement we had this trip.

                    Though I didn&#39t go camping in Grayton it was still a wonderful trip spent on some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It was the week leading up to my brother&#39s wedding, and my family and I spent 5 days in a house 30 ft. from the beginning of the dunes. Being landlocked for the last several years has made me appreciate the time I get on the ocean. Swimming in lakes and springs just don&#39t cut it for me compared to the beach. I&apos;m not sure why. Maybe it&#39s because I grew up on the white, sugar sand beaches of the Gulf Coast of Florida.

                    We had family and friends come in from all over to relax for the week leading up to the wedding with us. Our days were spent lounging on the sand and swimming in the crystal clear water. The sunsets are second to none here on the Emerald Coast.

                    My dad rented some beach cruisers for the house, so at least we got to ride bikes even without ours. We rode through a couple of the quaint towns on 30A. Life moves more slowly in these little beach towns but if you were to ask any resident, they would say that&#39s exactly why they live there.

                    If you&#39ve never had the opportunity to check out the Gulf Coast, I highly recommend a vacation there. If you want the best weather, make sure to check out May or September. It&#39s still plenty warm enough for swimming but not so hot that you feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving. Regardless of when you go, I promise you won&#39t be disappointed.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    I typically look for deals on gear and equipment so I can get the most for my money. Most of the things I&#39ve bought were from Sierra Trading Post, Moosejaw, and Amazon. Though I&#39m always looking for a deal I&#39m not afraid to spend the extra money on quality products that will last a long time.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Frugality is not the same as being cheap. People who are cheap want to spend the least amount possible on that purchase. The problem is the product often breaks down quicker and needs to be replaced causing you to spend more in the long run. Frugal people want to spend the least amount for the best quality for a product that will last the longest.

                    Getting away from it all is one of the best things you can do sometimes. When the stresses of modern day life become too much, sometimes getting out into the wilderness can be just what the doctor ordered. You come back refreshed and renewed and that&#39s exactly what happened to me this past weekend. Some friends and I got away to the Ocala National Forest for a little car camping.

                    When we arrived Friday evening it was already dark (which is always frustrating to set up a tent in) and rain was threatening. Thankfully the rain held off and we were able to get our tents up and fire going.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    We reheated some baked ziti that one of the friends had made and froze for our dinner. This turned out to be one of the nastiest meals I&#39ve had. Thankfully, when you&#39re hungry you just don&#39t care. The wood was a little wet and smoked a large amount because of that. This caused the ziti to have a smoked flavor that did not complement it. Between the four of us, we emptied about ⅓ of a container of parmesan on to the pasta (it was the only thing that seemed to neutralize the smoky flavor). The next few hours were us sitting around the fire sharing stories, cracking open a few beers, and of course, poking fun at the friend&#39s terribly executed dinner. We headed to bed but didn&#39t realize that we had a snorer amongst us. How I wish I would&#39ve grabbed ear plugs before bed. A night of tossing and turning attempting to block the noise was ahead of me.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Saturday morning I woke up early and went for a hike by myself around the lake. Everything was still in the forest except for a group of 4 deer who didn&#39t seem to care too much about me. They crossed the trail a few hundred feet ahead of me looking for breakfast. It was a peaceful time to relax and be alone with my thoughts. The beauty of nature always makes me contemplate what&#39s necessary in life. As I came back from my morning hike the whole campsite began to wake up and get their day started. I took another mid-morning hike with one of my friends. It was a great time to just hang out with him and catch up on life. The rest of the day was spent lounging around the campsite and throwing the football down by the lake.

                    That night, we met a group who definitely knew how to have a good time. They were celebrating a milestone, one of the guy&#39s 60th birthday. It was 4 friends and their families. Each had the exact same Jeep just in a different color. They had neon shirts, neon painted croquet balls, led string lights everywhere all of which corresponded to the color of their Jeep. They had black lights hooked up to their Jeeps to accentuate all the neon colors.

                    In speaking with them, they had met when they worked for their city to build a haunted house. They had done that for years and collected a large amount of haunted props throughout the years. They told me about how Halloween at their homes consists of house hopping between the 4 of them and checking out their incredibly elaborate displays. One guy had a &#34rain room&#34, in which he set up pipes to create fake rain as you walked across a bridge that would move due to hydraulics. Needless to say, they take Halloween to another level. I want to visit them in October and see these amazing houses.

                    Thankfully, I had ear plugs Saturday night. I slept like a rock and think I only woke up once. Sunday was our clean up and head out day. It put an end to an amazing weekend. It was unbelievable how quickly the time went by, I can&#39t wait to go again though. I hope if you haven&#39t been camping, you get out there and try it. Start with car camping and maybe you&#39ll eventually move into some more backcountry type through-hiking. Even if you don&#39t, just go be outdoors. There is so much outside our wifi and paved city streets. Also, become friends with the weird people at your campsite, they often provide the most memorable moments.

                    I grew up on the Panhandle of Florida with some of the world&#39s most beautiful beaches. At a young age, I fell in love with the outdoors. I remember spending hours pretending I was a spy or a soldier with the other boys my age in the woods around our neighborhood. As I got older, my fascination with the outdoors only grew. I bike to work just to get outside more, kayak when I can on the weekends, and take walks on local trails. I&#39m most at home outside the walls of my house.

                    As for the <a href='http://mountmckinney.com/campfirestories/'>Campfire Stories</a>, I will be bringing you tales from my time spent in the great outdoors. This could cover anything from backpacking in Denali, road trips to the Smoky Mountains, beach camping on the Gulf of Mexico, or even just a beautiful trail that I take with my lovely wife. I look forward to sharing these adventures with all of you. If you have a suggestion for where my next adventure should be, then I would love to hear your thoughts! Drop me an email or comment on my posts anytime.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    If I am going to purchase something to use in the backcountry, I have to make sure I get the best product for the money. This is what I promise you, that when I give you a recommendation on what fixed blade knife to buy, how to survive a bear attack, or what food to eat on the trail know that it comes after a countless hours of research. You can think of my articles as a summary of opinions. Instead of you taking time to read all about what product, say a sleeping bag, to buy, I have done that for you.
