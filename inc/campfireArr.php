                    As we drove from Kenmare through Moll&#39;s Gap this time we didn&#39;t take the right towards Killarney National Park. Instead, we headed left toward Lord Brandon&#39;s Cottage to leave our car for the day while we made the trek through the Gap of Dunloe. The road became a single lane for multiple miles. Thankfully, there were very few cars on it but with thick brush on both sides of the road, it made passing each other difficult. We missed multiple turns and got a little lost along the way but that&#39;s all part of the fun. Missing one turn took us to a serene lake, we definitely didn&#39;t mind that detour. After driving down what looked like someone&#39;s driveway we had finally found Lord Brandon&#39;s Cottage.

                    Online I had seen conflicting reports about whether you can drive the Gap of Dunloe or not. Some said it was ok just not advised due to the amount of horse-drawn carriages and hikers on the single lane road. Others said it was not legal to drive on the road. Regardless, we felt we didn&#39;t want to take the chance and would rather hike it anyway.

                    This was 100% the right call. While I didn&#39;t see any signs prohibiting cars and would often see cars on the road, they were more of a nuisance to the hikers due to how narrow the road is and the lack of a shoulder in my areas. Plus, you don&#39;t get to appreciate the views due to them going by so much more quickly. There are also some views that you don&#39;t get inside the car. If you are able to walk the long road, I highly recommend it.

                    We strapped on our 3 liter water reservoir backpack filled with trail mix, fruit, an external battery for our phones, and of course, the one thing you need in Ireland no matter what the sky looks like, our rain jackets. We began following the path back we had driven in on before stopping to &#34;baaaaa&#34; at sheep we saw on the side of the road. Don&#39;t lie you would do it too.

                    If you look at the picture to the left to this paragraph, you&#39;ll see the path we took from Lord Brandon&#39;s. This led us through the small township you see. After you pass the township, you&#39;ll come to a fork in the road. The sign is a tad confusing because it shows a hiking symbol pointed to the left, that hiking symbol is for those hiking the Kerry Peninsula. You want to head right. I say this because I saw people go left and then have to come back. If not for some kind bicyclists fortuitously climbing the mountain at that moment we may have made that same mistake. Thankfully, they were able to direct us to the correct path, all while going up the steep incline on their bikes.

                    We had followed the road up, we had reached the highest point on our path. We could see the vast Black Valley we had just come from stretching out behind us and the incredible sights of the Gap of Dunloe ahead of us. Stopping for a snack and a brief rest we had a short conversation with a white haired couple that was also making the 13 mile trip from Lord Brandon&#39;s to Kate Kearney&#39;s and back. They told us about how they had done this hike before but it was when they were much younger. I must say I am still impressed that they were able to complete this hike at their age.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Continuing down into the Gap, we were struck by the beauty of the cragginess of the mountains rising up on both sides of us. The path wound down and leveled off and became a leisurely stroll compared to the steep incline we had just came from. Sheep grazed on the side of the road and up on the mountains. They hopped effortlessly from rock to rock looking for that perfect blade of grass to chow down on.

                    Speaking of chowing down, we had made it to our halfway point, Kate Kearney&#39;s Cottage. This little restaurant and shop was a welcome sight after a few hours of walking. I, having no issue with doing so, ordered the lamb and it was delicious.

                    Hiking back through the Gap was just as beautiful as it was the first time. The hike back was so much easier due to us being on the descent on that steep road. Before heading back to Kenmare we decided to see what was down the road right past the parking area we had left our car at outside of Lord Brandon&#39;s Cottage. This turned out to almost be a costly mistake. The road turned into a dirt and gravel path and offered no place turn around. We had to make a u-turn on a road no wider than our car with a lot of mud right off the path. Thankfully, we didn&#39;t get stuck. It was to be our last night in Kenmare, our home for the past few days. So, of course, we decided to reward ourselves for our big day of hiking with an ice cream from the local shoppe.

                    I enjoyed every minute of hiking the Gap of Dunloe and I hope that when you visit Ireland, you make it part of your trip as well. There are easier ways of seeing it if you&#39;re not one for hours of hiking in a day. I&#39;ve seen people online talk about taking a boat from Ross Castle in Killarney National Park to Lord Brandon&#39;s Cottage then hiking to Kate Kearney&#39;s, followed by a short taxi ride back to Ross Castle. Though you could easily reverse this if you&#39;d like to avoid going up the steep incline. The only thing you would need to do is make sure you make it to Lord Brandon&#39;s early enough to catch the last boat to Ross Castle. This seems like a unique experience and one I would like to experience when we go back to Ireland one day.

                    Strangely, I don&#39;t believe this is that well known of a hike for many people in Ireland unless they are from that area. I have a friend from the northern area of West Ireland living here in the States now. When he asked what we would doing on our trip to Ireland I listed off a few things including the Gap of Dunloe. He told me he was only familiar with it because his American wife had also hiked the Gap.

                    Kenmare, a lovely town of just over 2,000, would be our home for the next few days. It&#39;s strange how a town so small by US standards felt much bigger there. Kenmare and Killarney are considered the 2 jumping off point for exploring the famous Ring of Kerry. If you&#39;re looking for a peaceful time with a lot less tourist-y feel, Kenmare is your type of place. Killarney was fun and not a large city by any means, but it is definitely more of a tourist central area.

                    No matter which town you stay in, you need to drive the road between them to see one of the most amazing views in Ireland in my opinion. Moll&#39;s Gap is a mountainous intersection of roads. Our first day in Kenmare, we headed to the Killarney National Park and needed to drive through Moll&#39;s Gap to get there. As we trekked along the mountain roads there came a point where the road curved to the right seemingly right into the rocks. We made that right and instantly a &#34;wooooooooowwwww!&#34; came from both our lips in exclamation. To be fair, Ireland would do this over and over again throughout our adventures.

                    We pulled off and just stared out into the vast mountain range with its valleys and windy roads. I love my wife, we both said when looking out at all of this, &#34;I can&#39;t wait to go hike this!&#34; Not wanting to miss any time hiking through one of only 6 National Parks in Ireland, we headed back to the car to drive those windy roads to Killarney town.

                    As windy as our drive along the Healy Pass was on the Beara Peninsula, the road to Killarney was far more so. This isn&#39;t a bad thing though, I thoroughly enjoyed driving the windy roads. Our little Hyundai was right at home along these windy roads to Killarney, but it was the tour buses (they&#39;re a recurring enemy of mine on this trip) that would make this road feel so much more difficult to drive on at times. But we had arrived. We had made it to Killarney National Park and it was awesome. The Emerald Isle was on full display here, the various shades of green shimmering in the sunlight.

                    Starting up the steep path through the woods we didn&#39;t make it far before we had to stop. Not from exhaustion but because we found a waterfall! I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m a sucker for waterfalls. Something about them is always cool to me. The rushing water creates a peaceful and relaxing noise that washes away all my worries. Though, while I&#39;m in Ireland, what worries do I have?

                    Many people made the short trip to the waterfall but few went further and climbing up the steep path to continue the hike and that&#39;s a shame. They missed some wonderful hiking to the top of the waterfall and views that you can&#39;t get from down in the parking lot. Maybe that&#39;s just me though, I have always been one to push that little bit further, knowing it almost always pays off. The views you get from vistas are great, but the best views are the ones you have to work to get to.

                    Eschewing the jaunting cars (horse-drawn carriages) that were rather pushy about getting us to hire them, we made our way to the Muckross House and Gardens. Situated on Muckross Lake and in the middle of Killarney National Park, this mansion is well worth the visit. Though, we were both expecting a mansion with grandeur similar to that of the Biltmore, this estate is far less expansive. However, the perfectly manicured grounds and gardens (which are free to visit) make this a place well worth the visit.

                    Leaving Muckross, we made our way to Killarney, which is a lot of fun to say in your best Irish brogue. Just don&#39;t do so around someone actually from Ireland...can&#39;t imagine you&#39;re good enough at it to pull it off. Walking around Killarney we stopped in little shops and even went into some of the tourist-y shops. After dinner, we decided to treat ourselves to a pastry from French pastry shop knowing that tomorrow we would be hiking about 13 miles in the Gap of Dunloe.

                    One thing we were surprised at while visiting the National Parks though was the lack of trails. At both Killarney and Connemara later there was very trails. At Connemara especially, there was only one trail that was broken up into three different loops.

                    Heading back through the windy roads to Kenmare, we decided to stop one more time at the first vista we came to upon entering the Park. Glad we did, a man was out there playing the bagpipes. Which is just awesome.

                    Where we <a href='http://mountmckinney.com/campfire/?story=irish-adventures'>last left off</a>, my wife and I were trans-Atlantic flight zombies staying the night in Kinsale. As we arose the next morning to greet the beautiful Irish morning, we felt so much better. We were ready to explore this gorgeous land that our families came from.

                    From Kinsale, we headed toward the West Coast to drive along the Beara Peninsula on the Ring of Beara. The lesser known cousin to the Ring of Kerry, the Ring of Beara doesn&#39;t see nearly as many tourists. I&#39;m not sure why because I thought it was actually more beautiful than the Ring of Kerry. With fewer cars (and buses) to clog up the roadways, we enjoyed unabated views of this national treasure. Just goes to show, that sometimes the best places aren&#39;t on the beaten path.

                    On the Ring of Beara is where we first experienced sheep walking on and around the road. They were everywhere. All with different color spray paint on them, I assume to designate who they belong to. As we drove the windy roads along Beara, we cut through the Peninsula by driving along the Healy Pass, which offered views of wide-open plains rising into high hills.  Upon seeing a pull-off near the top of the pass, we decided to go hillwalking.

                    Each time we reached a new vista, we had to just stop and stare. Ireland is truly one of the most beautiful places I&#39;ve ever been. There is something enchanting about Ireland. From the top of the hill, we could see a few houses around a beautiful lake at the bottom of the valley. We sat at the top of that hill for over half an hour just taking in the view and thanking God for an incredible landscape.

                    With so much left to see that day, we reluctantly made our way down toward the car to continue on. Our path took us right by that lake we had seen at the top of the hill. Venturing further we made our way to Derreen Gardens on the north coast of the Beara Peninsula.

                    Derreen Gardens is full of lush growth and fragrant flowers. A peaceful walk around the grounds made us feel as though we were in another time, one less concerned with the latest phone or who liked what on Facebook. We saw older couples taking walks and families having picnics by the water. Our own tranquil stroll through the gardens included plenty of time to stop and take it all in.

                    Sadly, eventually, we had to leave and make our way to where we would be staying the next few nights, Kenmare. A small town of 1,900, Kenmare is an easily walkable town. We had a wonderful night walking around the streets looking for shops that bear our surname. It was in Kenmare, that we got our first experience with Irish supermarkets.

                    It only took the entire summer for me to finally write about our trip to Ireland. As our flight took off from Orlando in mid-May, I knew we would be embarking on a truly once in a lifetime trip. After a short connection in Boston, we departed for Shannon! I had never been to Ireland but I knew I was excited to go and I knew I would love it. Boy was I right, it was hard to leave such a breathtakingly beautiful country. My grandmother had come to America from Ireland when she was a little girl. Being in a place that only 2 generations before had been my family&#039;s home made me immediately feel at home there. Not to mention that I definitely could pass for an Irish citizen, well at least until I spoke obviously.

                    It&#039;s been a long time since I was as tired as I was that first day. The flight was overnight and I slept for at most 45 mins. Never really been able to sleep on planes (or in cars for that matter). Thankfully, I was at least comfortable, as I had sprung the extra cash for a bulkhead seat. I am 6&#039; 4&#034; so that extra legroom was a lifesaver. As we got into our rental car, I sat in the driver&#039;s seat and immediately just felt odd. I was sitting on the opposite side of the car from my everyday driving. Changing gears, grabbing my water bottle, and even holding my wife&#039;s hand was now my left hand&#039;s responsibility. For the most part, we were fine driving on the left side of the road, though we did have one close call when I had to make a right turn while going around a bend in a busy town with tour buses all around me.

                    Oh those wretched tour buses. The smallest of them take up the entire lane and most venture into your lane. I honestly felt bad for the people in them, they wouldn&#039;t experience Ireland the way my wife and I did. They couldn&#039;t take a detour, change their plans last minute, or just stop on the side of the road to hike. They missed some of the most amazing sights that we experienced.

                    Our first major stop was to experience that great liquid gold, Irish whiskey. We headed south from Shannon to Middleton, the home of the Jameson Distillery. What a blast that was. I learned so much and got to drink some delicious whiskey doing it. At the end of the tour, I participated in a taste test with Jameson 12 yr, Jonnie Walker Black, and Jack Daniels. Somehow, I feel they didn&#039;t exactly go for top-shelf when it came to bourbon.

                    After our whiskey tour, we headed to Cobh to see St. Colman&#039;s Cathedral. This massive gothic Cathedral towers over the town, as you can see in the picture. The Cathedral was gorgeous (as were all the Cathedrals we visited in Ireland). This one, right on the Cork Harbour, provided picturesque views both inside and out.

                    From there, we made our way to where we&#039;d be staying the first night, Kinsale. A small town on the River Bandon on the South edge of Ireland, Kinsale is a quaint town that is well worth the stop for the night. Our first (but not last) Irish poured Guinness was ordered in a pub in Kinsale. We felt a bit like zombies that first day except without wanting to eat braaaaaainnnssss. I had gotten less than an hour of sleep in 40 hours. Needless to say, I was very excited when that first day&#039;s rest came. I was out as soon as my head hit the pillow.

                    Sometimes you need to just get away and revitalize yourself. In mid-April, it was time for me and my wife to do just that. We decided a B&B trip to Savannah, GA for the weekend was the perfect getaway. It was a wonderful, relaxing experience in one of my favorite cities. We stayed at the <a href='http://dresserpalmerhouse.com/'>Dresser Palmer House</a> right near <a href='http://visithistoricsavannah.com/forsyth-park/'>Forsyth Park</a>. The weather was gorgeous, only feeling hot when we went hiking in non-shaded parts of <a href='http://gastateparks.org/SkidawayIsland'>Skidaway Island State Park</a> and being cold enough to wear a jacket in the evenings.

Friday night was spent going to dinner at the <a href='http://www.crystalbeerparlor.com/'>Crystal Beer Parlor</a> eating one of the best peach cobblers I&#039;ve ever had and then going for a long walk around the city to walk off said cobbler. Overall, a pretty chill night.

                    Saturday we headed out to the <a href='http://www.gastateparks.org/Wormsloe'>Wormsloe Historic Site</a> (unfortunate name if you ask me) which is the colonial estate of Noble Jones (awesome name). Wormsloe has the most amazing drive, a canopy of live oaks and Spanish moss creating a drive like no other. The drive was incredible and I was able to capture it on the GoPro with time lapse which you can see below. After driving in, there are some trails you can take, as well as tours of the historic recreations of the village led by rangers. These historic recreations include a blacksmith shop and a small house. Wormsloe was certainly something worth checking out at least once.

                    After Wormsloe, we made the short drive to Skidaway Island State Park. This state park had a nice trail leading out to a river. On the banks of the river, we stood just enjoying the silence of nature. Such a peaceful moment with the water softly flowing by and lapping up onto the riverbank. Heading back into the city, Saturday evening was spent walking around the city, people watching from a bench in one of the parks, and of course going to the giant candy shop on River Street. We attended the vigil Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral as well which is a beautiful church and a definite must see.

                    Sunday at the B&B we had delicious peaches and cream french toast which I&#039;m still dreaming about. Before leaving Savannah we went to <a href='https://www.nps.gov/fopu/index.htmFort'>Fort Pulaski</a>, which ended up being the highlight of our trip. This 19th Century fort is on the way to Tybee Island and is a National Monument. You can read the full write-up I did of Fort Pulaski for the sports/outdoor blog website, Sportody, <a href='http://www.sportody.com/blog/must-do-historical-sites-near-savannah-fort-pulaski'>here</a>. However, the gist of the experience was that there were tons of cannons (always a favorite of mine), we played 19th Century baseball (I got a double), and the fort was awesome! Basically, you need to go to Savannah immediately!

                    I invite you to try an exercise with me. Close your eyes and picture a place you&#39;ve always wanted to go. Picture what this place looks like. Is it a majestic mountain, a waterfall crashing upon the rocks below, or a city in some distant land? Next, think of what this place would smell like. Do hints of primrose and pine fill the air? Maybe it&#39;s homemade Italian pasta and a bottle of old wine that saturate your senses. Lastly, what do you hear? Is French music playing? How about birds singing their happy songs as they go about their day? Or maybe the only sound for miles is your footsteps and the wind. Go ahead, close your eyes now, I&#39;ll wait.

                    I hope your day already has a large amount of adventure. I hope it doesn&#39;t seem to drag on from one day to the next. I hope it doesn&#39;t consist of you waking up, sitting at a desk constantly checking the clock, sitting in traffic, and finally crawling into bed all to do it over again the next day. However, if it does then it&#39;s time to get out there and change that. First, you probably want to find a different job, one that fulfills you more. Second, it&#39;s time for you to get out and experience the great adventure that is life.

                    I&#39;m not saying you should quit your job and travel the world until you&#39;re flat broke. We all have responsibilities to family and you need to have money in order to travel. However, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t still do the things we want to do and go to the places we&#39;ve always wanted to see. I believe we find ways to fund and find time for the things we make a true priority in our lives.

                    What&#39;s holding you back from getting out there? Do you feel like you can&#39;t get away from the office? I understand that feeling. It&#39;s very common to feel like you can&#39;t leave due to fears of how your clients or colleagues could focus without you there. The truth is, though, they&#39;ll get along just fine without you. I know that can make some people sad or feel unimportant. I don&#39;t mean to get you down. I tell you that to free you from putting so much stock in your job that you forget to ever truly live.

                    Is money the issue that&#39;s keeping you from traveling? If so, I have a couple recommendations for you. First, set up a dedicated travel account. Then, set up automatic transfers to that travel account. Next step, don&#39;t look at the balance very often and you&#39;ll be amazed at quickly the money accumulates. Another tip, would be to cut out things that are less important than traveling to you and then take the money you&#39;ve saved and put it in the account. Go out to eat all the time? Cook more at home. Drink Starbucks every day? Brew your own coffee. Cable is expensive and if you really want to watch TV, the <a href='http://www.gomohu.com/'>Mohu</a> Leaf and <a href='http://www.hulu.com/'>Hulu</a> are much more affordable options.

I think 3 of the 5 are especially poignant. &#34;I wish I&#39;d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&#34; &#34;I wish I hadn&#39;t worked so hard.&#34; &#34;I wish that I had let myself be happier.&#34 Don&#39;t get to the end of your days and wonder what you did with your life and wish you could&#39;ve lived differently. Live this life out as the grand adventure that it is.

                    I love the mountains, nothing else causes me to say &#34;wow!&#34;, &#34;woah!&#34;, and &#34;that&#39;s beautiful!&#34; so often...other than when I&#39;m with my wife, of course. This was our final full day and we spent it exploring the Blue Ridge Parkway, an amazing way to finish up the trip. As we drove down the winding roads, we found ourselves constantly wanting to pull over to take pictures, each vista seemingly more beautiful than the last. The best stop we made was at Waterrock Knob.

                    An awe-inspiring place, Waterrock Knob boasts one of the highest peaks along the Blue Ridge. The parking lot has incredible views for sure, allowing you to see above the whole horizon. The best views are at the top of the trail of the peak at the back of the parking lot. We set out on the walking path that turned into a trail shortly. Most of the leaves on the trees along the trail had already fallen due to the high altitude. This ended up being a blessing as it allowed us to see the incredible views along the hike without being obstructed. The peak offered even better views and was well worth the effort it took to climb. The most interesting thing was seeing the road winding through the mountains. From our vantage, cars resembled toys and people were mere ants.

                    We continued the winding road through the mountains. I love driving these type of roads, they&#39;re just plain fun and when you add the fall foliage it&#39;s even better. The trailhead of our next hike had a picnic table and we used the opportunity to have a surface to eat on. The weather had gotten windy and cold due to the altitude so it wasn&#39;t as pleasant as we had hoped when we initially packed our picnic lunch. As we looked up from our table to the cliff high above us, I noticed some people on top of it. I remember thinking how high up they were and that it was going to hurt to make that climb.

                    The trail was steep but paved for the beginning, definitely a good thigh workout! Hiking is one of those things that&#39;s always worth it when you reach your destination, no matter how painful it was at the time. This was no exception. Knowing the hike ends with a waterfall or a mountain summit always help me push further than I think I can at the bottom. Saying this makes me realize I&#39;m essentially a donkey chasing after a carrot.

                    The trees along the trail were dense, which made the point where it finally opened up at the summit, even more, amazing. The view seemed to stretch on forever. I can still see the mountain peaks in the distance rising above the valleys. Various collections of oranges, reds, yellows, greens, and browns littered the horizon. Some areas looked like a fire was ablaze on the mountain, while other areas almost glowed with their golden leaves.

                    Much to my wife&#39;s chagrin, I love having it and plan on keeping it at least until the Florida summer starts up again (which can honestly be as early as March). For any guys out there debating whether or not to don the crumb catcher, I recommend giving it a try. It&#39;s an exercise in patience to make it past the itching and ridicule you&#39;ll undoubtedly receive the first week or so (well unless you&#39;re a Greek man whose facial grows at an unnatural rate, you know who you are).

                    This is my long overdue post about our trip to North Carolina. I tell ya, sometimes it&#39;s way too easy to let things get away from you. I think my New Years resolution is to write these while I&#39;m on the trip, that and to make blogging a much more regular thing. Expect to see a new blog post every other Monday afternoon. Ya, I think that&#39;s a good goal to have, not too overwhelming right? Better than buying a gym membership that doesn&#39;t get used after the first few weeks of the year. Definitely never done that before... We&#39;ll see how this goes. Wish me luck I guess?

                    Now, where was I? Oh right! I was about to tell you about my trip to Maggie Valley, NC just outside of Asheville. The last week of October, my wife and I, joined by another married couple friend of ours loaded up the car and headed north for a trip to see the Fall foliage. This has become an annual trip for me over the past few years with friends but now as a newly married man, I was able to make it a couples weekend.

                    It turns out we came at the perfect time for our multi-day trip. The leaves were amazing! They had only started to change at the elevation our cabin was at. The picture above is from our back patio of the cabin. No camping for me this time, our friends and my wife prefer the comforts a cabin provide. Anyway, the trees just outside cabin started as mostly yellow and by the end of our trip were a conglomeration of yellow, orange, and red. It always amazes me how beautiful it is to look at trees.

                    Our first day trip for hiking was to the beautiful Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Nestled between Cherokee, NC and Gatlinburg, TN (two rather touristy towns) is this gorgeous piece of protected national land. It was a place I had road tripped to the past couple years with friends, but this was a different experience than previous trips. The Sun was out most of the day and it was on the warmer side that day so our climb up the Chimney Tops was actually painful on the hands. You can see the rocks that we climbed in the picture to the right. The rocks burned our hands as we ascended, but boy is that view ever worth it.

                    After burning our hands, we headed down the mountain and headed to our next destination, a waterfall not far from our cabin. Not sure why but I always love sticking my head under waterfalls (especially when the water is ice cold). It certainly was cold, but well worth the dunk. That night was spent relaxing in the hot tub at the cabin. After a long day of hiking, it was exactly what we needed.

                    The next day was a day off from hiking. In the morning, we headed over to Hendersonville to Grandad&#39;s Apple Farm. Surprisingly warm out and definitely late in the season our dreams of picking an apple straight from the tree were kind of dashed. I was able to find one good apple to pluck, but it took longer than we&#39;d like to admit to find that good one. While there we had a nice picnic lunch and made sure to grab some delicious apple snacks to go with our food. If you go there I highly recommend the apple cider smoothie and the apple dumpling a la mode, quite delicious.

                    Next up was Burntshirt Vineyards, a lovely vineyard that served some surprisingly good wine. Reminding me slightly of the vineyards I toured in Napa Valley, though those were a good bit larger. It was well worth the trip especially because it was right down the road from Grandad&#39;s Farm. We had a tour of the vineyards and received lots of great info on how they make the wine. It was a tranquil and quaint place, I think just relaxing on the rocking chairs was my favorite part. Although a close second was the wine tasting.

                    Sadly, this is the end of our trip. Thank you New Mexico for an incredible trip. The last trip for us was to the Sandia Peak. Seated atop one of the Sandia Mountain peaks is Sandia Peak, a ski area and restaurant. Apparently, High Finance is the highest full service restaurant in the US. To get up to the peak you take a tramway, the longest aerial tram ride in the US.

Thankfully, I&#39;m not afraid of heights or else I might have had a rougher trip up to the peak. However, even if you aren&#39;t afraid of heights you may still feel woozy if you happen to look through the slits in the air grate on the floor.

                    We reached the peak of 10,000 feet, got off the gondola, and almost kissed the ground (kidding). We stopped by High Finance for a drink and sat out on the deck to enjoy the view with the beer. It was an amazing view, we saw mountains littering the landscape. Below, the city of Albuquerque sprawled out before us and all of it looked so tiny.

                    After eating lunch at Jemez Falls and checking out the Valles Caldera we headed over to the Bandelier National Monument near Los Alamos. As we rolled in, so did the storms. We were worried this would keep us from getting to see this interesting piece of history. The Rangers, informed us that the storms looked like they would be staying up on the plateau and the canyon should be fine. We waited a few minutes and then headed out in the light rain.

                    Thankfully, after a few more minutes, the rain subsided. After a short stroll, slightly damp, we arrived at the monument. It was definitely an impressive sight. We saw the cave dwellings, built into the side of the canyon walls. Below, there was remnants of a rather large village.

                    We walked along the nicely laid out steps, with railings up to the entrance of the first dwelling that we could enter via ladder. There was already someone in that one and a family with two small children waiting to get in. We decided that we would just skip this one and enter the next one. Following the path a little further along we saw a few <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph'>petroglyphs</a> on the walls inside and outside the dwellings.

                      There were clearly multiple &#34;floors&#34; of dwellings, as well as having multi-level houses down below. We came across the next ladder and climbed up, as a tall person I can say that I would not have fared well in those back then. In reading the guide from the ranger station, the average male was 5 foot 6 and the average female was 5 foot. I&#39;m not sure how someone even that size could stay in those very long. I was hunched over my entire time in the dwelling.

                    We exited that dwelling and moved along to the last dwelling that you could enter in that area, I enjoyed this one much more. It was tall enough for me to stand upright and move around. I could definitely enjoy an amazing night&#39;s sleep in that dark cave.

                    In reading the guide book more to find out about this interesting people, I learned that life was difficult and the average lifespan was only 35 years. So maybe my dark cave would not have provided me that good night&#39;s sleep after all, at least not back then. It&#39;s always important to remember how good we have it in this day and age. I enjoyed my experience learning more about the people who once inhabited the walls of the Frijoles Canyon.

                    This was the most diverse day of the trip. We headed out from the Sandia foothills near Albuquerque and made our way to the red rock deserts on the way to the Soda Dam near Jemez Springs. The red rock deserts were beautiful, a vibrant red like I had never seen. It felt like I was on Mars. From there we headed to the Soda Dam.

                    The Soda Dam, an interesting sight to say the least, is a dam formed by the collection of minerals. It looked a lot like something out of a science fiction movie. It was definitely not your typical waterfall, but was worth the stop on our way. After that brief stop, we followed the road into the mountains. We winded our way through the sprawling pine tree lined paths.

                    We stopped for lunch at Jemez Falls, it reminded me of pictures of Colorado. I&#39;m partial to the green mountain landscapes like these over the brown ones, like the Sandia Mountains. It was beautiful, we spent a great deal of time exploring here. We climbed on rocks, sat near the edges of cliffs, and skipped rocks on the river. Eventually, however, we did have to leave.

                    From there we drove toward Bandelier National Monument. We came around a bend and were compelled to stop. There were these incredible plains with mountains surrounding them. A long time ago, a super volcano stood where the Valles Caldera stands. The Valles was formed by this super volcano collapsing.

                    We stood and stared at the immense beauty of the sight. I learned from locals later that evening that elk typically roam the Valles. Sadly, we didn&#39;t see any elk while we were there. It was hard to believe that in one day we had seen so much. New Mexico had certainly not disappointed and we weren&#39;t even done for the day.

                    Finally, we left the beautiful plains of the Valles and made our way to Bandelier. It was difficult to understand just how big the Valles is. As we were driving around the perimeter we looked down and had few things to judge the size against. Then, we saw a SUV driving on one of the roads in the middle. It looked much smaller than we felt it should. After research into the Valles, we learned that it is almost 14 miles wide.

                    We stayed in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains on historic Route 66. It was my first time on Route 66, unfortunately, we didn&#39;t spend much time exploring it. We did play the classic Chuck Berry song while on it though. It&#39;s amazing the wildlife that grows regardless of climate. Every time we left the house we saw rabbits and while leaving the house one evening we even got to see a bobcat. I was thankful to be in a house that was surrounded by so much nature.

                    There were a number of beautiful trails into the foothills near our house. One evening, my wife and I ventured out onto one before dinner. We began down the path and came upon a couple of large boulders stacked on top of each other. We, of course, climbed them. After taking a couple goofy pictures, we climbed down and continued on our path.

                    We came to a fork in the path and opted to take the more rugged, primitive trail. We followed it along and made a few wrong turns here and there trying to stay on the path. Finally after walking on that path a good ways, we decided we didn&#39;t think it was prudent to continue on the trail. There were too many points that we could easily lose the trail on the way back. So we headed back before we got ourselves lost.

                    We came back to that fork and headed onto the other trail that is much more defined. Though even this trail had plenty of cacti protruding into the trail. You had to be watchful of where you stepped in some areas. At one point the road sloped downward pushing me to speed up my walk. At the bottom there to greet me was a cacti about chest high. Thankfully, I stopped prior to getting stuck.

                    The first hike of the trip was to go to the Kasha Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument (say that 5x fast). This is a slot canyon west of Santa Fe, definitely worth the hike. This was my first experience in a slot canyon.

                    As we walked up to the entrance, the canyon walls felt more and more ominous. We traversed through narrow points where the canyon floor was smaller than the width of my shoes. At one point, we had to crouch walk under a boulder easily large enough to squash us. Thankfully, it was firmly wedged between the canyon walls. We twisted and turned our way and finally came to a point where the trail turned toward the top of the canyon.

                    As interesting as it was being inside the slot canyon, it wasn&#39;t until we rose high above the canyon floor that the sights became breathtaking. We climbed the makeshift rock stairs. I kept thinking, what was the first person to do this thinking. There were points that would certainly have been extremely difficult if not for the railroad ties added to the trail to help create better steps.

                    We climbed higher and higher, each time we turned around we were rewarded with an increasingly beautiful view. We turned around and saw the iconic tent rock formations this site is known for. We ascended more of the path and turned around again, this time seeing more of the canyon, more of the tent rocks, and this time mountains off in the distance. Now I knew there was something truly worth it to climb to the top for. I pushed harder and hiked faster, I wanted to see the vista at the peak.

                    Reaching that peak was well worth the hike. What a gorgeous site, the land stretched on for miles and miles. Off in the distance in nearly every direction there were mountains. Down below you could see the tent rocks and the people traversing their way in and out of the canyon. The view compelled us to be speechless (which if you&#39;ve ever met me is not my natural state).

                    It was difficult to want to trek down to the car from such awe inspiring beauty. Eventually, we had to make that journey though. As we reached the car, my wife had to make her customary statement whenever we do any sort of climb like that, &#34;Can you believe we were just at the top of that?!&#34; It&#39;s not really a trip for me unless I hear her say that.

                    This was my first trip to the American Southwest for a hiking trip. I have to admit, I was not expecting it to be nearly as beautiful as it was. I expected New Mexico to be a vast desert with little diversity in the landscape. I always kind of wondered why people would live in what I viewed as such as a harsh climate. I was never so happy to be wrong.

                    We spent a week in and around the Albuquerque area (still can&#39;t spell that right without spellcheck). Our house for the week nestled in the Sandia Mountains. As we ventured out into the wilderness, the true beauty of the state became apparent. We saw red rock deserts, pine tree covered mountains, Native American cave dwellings, the Rio Grande, white limestone mountains, and plains resembling those in Wyoming. I was amazed that on one particular driving day, we saw most of that list in just a few hours.

                    The climate was also comfortable, this being August and the weather while warm was nothing compared to Florida&#39;s 90&#39;s and humid summer days. Personally, I&#39;m just more partial to hiking in cooler weather and like to save my multi-hour hikes for the cooler months.

                    Overall I was very impressed with the New Mexico. I always love diverse landscapes. Mountains are majestic to me, most likely due to the fact that the highest natural point in Florida is Britton Hill. This hill is a towering 312 feet. Even foothills are wonderful to someone who grew up 50 feet or less above sea level. I think my next trip to the Southwest will be to finally check out the Big Five in Utah or to see the Grand Canyon from up close, as opposed to just flying over it.

                    However, as gorgeous as the Southwest was, I&#39;m happy to be living in the Southeast. I have never been so thirsty for a week straight, my throat was constantly dry. I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get use to it, I&#39;m just not sure I would want to. I don&#39;t mind the heat and humidity of Florida and the non-summer months are incredible weather-wise.

                    We blew up the kiddie pools, laid out the plastic sheets, and put water and soap on everything. It was a high-scoring affair, I believe one game was around 19-17 and the other shorter game was 16-8. The score was obviously less important than the fun (though my team won both games...just saying). We made the rules up as we went. Cutting outs from 3 to an inning to 2, requiring slides at every base (even on a home run), and deciding whether you could steal bases or not halfway through the game. It felt a lot like when you&#39;re young, creating games with the neighborhood kids. It was a blast.

                    There were mishaps for sure, people knocking over the pools (due to the sheer speed a slip &#39;n slide launches you), slipping in the outfield, and kicks that somehow went backwards. For example: we, being adults now (sort of), were a little weary of our initial slide. However, after you learn the oh so important, NEVER SLIDE ON YOUR STOMACH AS AN ADULT, you&#39;re fine.

                    About 30 mins into the game, it started to pour, it was great! Our sliding went further and the mistakes increased greatly, all increasing the laughter. There are few activities where you hope it will rain on you, this is one.

                    Following the game, we spent time just running between each of the bases sliding. I haven&#39;t felt that much like a kid in a long time. It was a great feeling, one I plan to try and recreate this coming weekend when we play slip &#39;n slide kickball. Let the good times roll...or slide in this case.

I ride my bike to work a large amount of the time. It is not uncommon to get stuck in a downpour and my Overboard pack protects my belongings. What does this have to do with camping deep in the woods?

                    Well, the Overboard pack is still my choice of backpack, even when hiking. I know that it doesn&#39t have the internal frame that traditional packs have and doesn&#39t have all the bells and whistles that other packs have. For me though, it&#39s exactly what I need.

                    When I&#39m out hiking in the woods, the last thing I want to think about is if my sleeping bag, tent, and clothes are going to get soaked if a thunderstorm rolls in. I know they have rain covers for regular packs but why buy something extra on top of an already expensive pack?

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    I know that other packs are made of lighter weight materials but it&#39s not like my bag is heavy, at just about 3 lbs. For far less than a typical pack I get IP66 protection and while that means it&#39s not completely waterproof it performs more than satisfactory. It has a pocket on each side as well as an internal pocket and has various loops to clip items to it on the outside. I am always looking for an upgraded pack that is extremely light and waterproof at the same time, but I rarely find any that offer what I&#39m looking for. If they do, they are often quite expensive and don&#39t offer a large enough improvement to justify the cost.

                    For awhile, I really wanted the 35L Sea to Summit Hydraulic Pack. I thought it would be my new go to pack. It has 5L more than my current pack and is completely waterproof. There was a great sale so I picked it up. I tried packing all the things I had packed in my 30L pack and found it to be more difficult. Maybe it&#39s the way space is used in the Sea to Summit versus the Overboard. Possibly it was because of the difference in shape, the rectangular Overboard versus the cylindrical Sea to Summit. I&#39m not sure why it didn&#39t fit as much. This was the bag I had wanted for a few months and when I got it I was disappointed. So for now I will continue to use my Overboard pack.

                    The Sawyer Mini is worth every bit of the $20 I spent on it. It&#39s lightweight, portable, and doesn&#39t take up a lot of room in your pack. I remember seeing the LifeStraw and thinking, while it&#39s a great idea for emergency situations it seems very limited. You would have to lean down near the water and sip from the stream. You have no way of transferring water to a water bottle for later drinking.

                    I suppose you could fill your bottles and sip from them, but this seems ineffective as now your bottles are contaminated. The other option, is water filtration tablets. I&#39ve tried these before and while they&#39re effective, they can leave the water tasting...less than ideal.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    Then there is the Sawyer Mini. The compact water filtration system that cleans water effectively and doesn&#39t leave the water tasting terrible. It comes with a foldable water pouch so you can collect water from the stream.

                  <p class='blogContent'>
                    From there you screw on the Sawyer and either squeeze the water out of the pouch into your water bottle or you can drink it from the Sawyer. Another benefit of the Sawyer is it can be attached inline to a Camelbak. I haven&#39t personally done this, because I don&#39t have a Camelbak but it is fairly straightforward to do from what I&#39ve seen online.

                    The Sawyer being the right choice for me became cemented the first time I used it while on a weekend hike in the mountains of Georgia. I was extremely thirsty and instead of having to lean down near the stream and drink while holding myself up from not falling in the stream. I was able to simply lean down fill up a water pouch and drink. It was a simple affair, it left me impressed with the Sawyer.

                    Having clean drinking water while camping is paramount, and to do so without adding extra weight is especially useful. Water is adds a large amount of weight to your pack but an obvious necessity.

                    Having a way to not have to cut down on the amount you will need to carry without having to boil the water to make it safe is always worth the cost. At around $20 it&#39s not a painful cost for a large benefit. The Sawyer is my go to for having filtered water on my hikes. Stay hydrated, not thirsty my friends.

                    This past weekend, a friend and I headed up to the Cohutta Mountains in Northwest Georgia to hike the Cohutta Mountain Loop. It was absolutely gorgeous out there. We parked at the Three Forks Trailhead and headed out on the East Cowpen trail. My friend had a running watch to measure our distance traveled as well as elevation changes throughout the trip. We started at an elevation of 3,200 ft. and began to descend into the Cohutta Wilderness.

                    What we didn&#39t know when we started off on the trail was the lack of water that would be available on the trail we took. I had read some reviews of the area and some stories from the specific loop we were planning on doing and all the pictures were of people down by a river. What I didn&#39t realize was that the first time we&#39d see a river on the trail we took in would be when we got to the Jacks River after hiking just under 8 miles and dropping 2,000 ft. in elevation.

                    We had some water but I drink a lot and when we got down to the river after those 8 miles, I drank 4 bottles of water immediately and then another 4 when I got to camp. We used the Sawyer Mini for water filtration. It is definitely one of the best purchases I&#39ve ever made, it&#39s ultra portable and cleans the water effectively.

                    We then had to wade our way through the stream a couple of times to get to an open area to make camp. Slipping my feet into the cold water stream water after a good day of hiking was one of the more refreshing feelings I&#39ve had. The area we found was right on the river bank, just far enough back to have dry, solid ground but still right on the river. We set up the camp, started a fire, and ate dinner. It was so peaceful out there. The sound of the river lulled me to sleep, well that is until 5 mins after closing my eyes when nature called. All that water I guzzled to get rehydrated was ready to be set free. I must have woken up 4-5 times that night.

                    The next morning, we packed up camp and headed down to see the Jack&#39s River Falls. The hike down to the Falls was great. As we weaved our way around the river down we started to hear the thundering sound of a waterfall. The falls were beautiful, we just stopped and stared at them for awhile, neither of us wanting to move on. We pushed further to try and get different views of the natural beauty that was before us. After having our fill, who am I kidding I could still be there staring at them, we headed out on the trail back toward our car. We were at an elevation of 1,200 ft. now and were dreading the climb back.

                    The trail back was definitely painful, 2,000 ft. increase in 8 miles. We would boo out loud whenever the trail dropped in elevation for more than a few steps knowing that we would have to climb it again. The most frustrating thing was not the elevation increases, but that we thought there would be water on this trail. We quickly realized we were wrong and we would need to conserve water as we watched the trail we were on and the river part ways. We did stop for lunch at an area that clearly fed into the river, however, it had been dried up to mostly mud at this time of year.

                    If I was to do another hike in this area, which I would definitely not be opposed to, I would take the Jack&#39s River Trail the whole way. The lack of water on the trail we took was definitely a detriment to us staying an extra night out there. If we were take a trail that stayed on or close to the river the whole way we definitely would have stayed longer. Oh well, you live and you learn right? All in all we descended 2,000 ft. and ascended that same amount, as well as hiking a total of 20 miles. Definitely not a bad way to spend a Memorial Day weekend.

                    We stayed in Atlanta Sunday night so we would be fresh driving home the next day. That post backpacking shower is one of the best things that this life has to offer. After getting cleaned up, we went out for dinner at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur. Their beer selection was exactly what was needed after hiking 20 miles in 2 days. I don&#39t know if it was the best beer I&#39ve ever had but it definitely tasted like it.

                    Down here in Florida, it&#39s already in the 90&#39s even in early May. Those temperatures can make camping a lot more uncomfortable. Add the daily afternoon thunderstorm and you can see why most don&#39t camp in Florida in the summer. Despite that my wife and I joined another married couple and headed out for one last camping trip in Florida before it&#39s unbearable to camp until September. It was an amazing time, the weather wasn&#39t too hot and the thunderstorms subsided for a sunny weekend.

                    When we arrived Saturday morning, we set up our 6 person mansion of a tent that we shared for the night. You would never lug this thing into the backcountry, but it was every bit of car camping luxury. It was definitely interesting to be able to actually stand up at all, let alone fully upright while in the tent. My little 2 person tent barely lets me kneel.

                    After setting up our camp and tent we headed out for a short hike. The water around Juniper Springs, is gorgeous and crystal clear. We didn&#39t venture onto the Florida Trail which goes right near Juniper Spring, due to it not having much shade and it was already high 80s. We stuck to the short nature trails around the campground and the swimming area. While on our short hike, we snapped some shots of a few turtles sunbathing. It was a lazy Saturday for us and for all of nature. We made our way to the springs for a dip in the chilly spring waters. It felt amazing once we got in, but boy that initial descent into the water is painful.

                    After a late lunch and a game of bocce ball, we headed back to the springs for swimming round 2. The heat had subsided a good bit and that made the jump back into the water that much more freezing. We spent the afternoon relaxing, jumping off the platform into the water, and racing each other in the water. It was a wonderful day to get away from not only the heat but the city as well. Our evening was spent playing card games, sitting around the fire, and chatting.

                    Sunday, my wife and I took another short hike in the morning and even got to see a deer 10 ft ahead of us before she scurried into the woods. I love relaxing weekends like these. The fresh air and sunny skies are exactly what I need. Out in the peace and quiet you can gather your thoughts and let go of the things that seem so important in your daily life. I think that&#39s the real beauty of the outdoors, they allow you to forget what you deem important and focus on what truly is: your friends, family, and of course having a little fun.

                    All the knives I looked into were full-tang. I did a large amount of looking around before deciding upon the SCHF26. I originally thought I would go with the KA-BAR US Marine Corp, the Ontario 499 Air Force, or the SOG Seal Pup Elite. All are great knives, however, when I held them in my hand they just didn&#39t find feel quite right. I have large hands, so it is important to me to have a handle that is long enough. The KA-BAR and the Seal Pup just felt a little short in my hand for comfort. The Ontario had similar specs as the KA-BAR but was difficult to find locally so I ended up passing on it.

                    After passing on those, I began a new search. My new selections brought me to the KA-BAR BK-22 and the Schrade SCHF9. I thought I would go with the BK-22, I had it in my shopping cart and everything. It was an excellent knife, highly rated, and not a bad price at about $80 on Amazon. The BK-22 has a thick spine at a quarter inch and can take a beating. It&#39s made from 1095 Cro-Van steel Solid. I was about to purchase it, when someone suggested I look at the SCHF26. As I looked into it I began to like it more and more. I watched videos and articles comparing the BK-22 and the SCHF26 and most people agreed that the SCHF26 is just a better value.

                    I pulled the trigger and ordered the SCHF26. I love it. The grip has a rubbery feel, it feels like it wouldn&#39t slip out of my hand even if I was doing something in the rain. It has a spine that is a quarter inch thick and flat. It has a sharp point and is a single edge blade. The weight distribution just felt right in my hands. It was a length I liked by staying just under 11&#34 and had a large handle at 5.4&#34. I&#39m very happy with my purchase, needless to say.

                    For selecting your own knife, there are many that will work. I was splitting hairs comparing many knives, many of which I didn&#39t list. People get very opinionated about which knife is best, and that&#39s fine, we are all passionate about different things. I just think that as long as it is a knife that is full-tang, the right size, the right shape, and made of a good material you will be fine. Often, picking a knife is best done by placing it in your hand and determining if it passes the initial gut test. Good luck picking out a knife and if you have questions or comments, feel free to leave them below!

                    My wife and I packed up Tuesday night and headed to the beach house a few hours from home, our stuff loaded up in the car and bikes secured on the trunk bike rack. I say secured but what I mean is we thought they were secured. I learned two valuable lessons this past Tuesday, don&#39t skimp on a bike rack and make sure you&#39ve double and triple checked that you&#39ve installed it correctly. We were in such a hurry and it was the first time we had used our bike rack that I didn&#39t place the side straps in the position they needed to be. It was probably not best to try a new bike rack out for the first time on a multi-hour interstate trip...I guess I learned three valuable lessons then.

                    Anyway, we were on the interstate for 30 mins and everything seemed to be fine, I had been keeping a constant eye on the bikes to make sure they weren&#39t wobbling. Then not more than a minute later, we drove over a dip in the road. It was enough of a bounce to cause the lower bar to swing closed and caused the bikes to swing down toward the road. I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and inspected the bikes. Thankfully the only damage was that on my wife&#39s new bike (when I say new I mean one day old) the front tire had dragged on the asphalt and burned a hole in the tire and tube. It definitely could&#39ve been worse. We reattached the bikes and drove back the 30 mins home, put the bikes inside and headed out again. That was all the excitement we had this trip.

                    Though I didn&#39t go camping in Grayton it was still a wonderful trip spent on some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It was the week leading up to my brother&#39s wedding, and my family and I spent 5 days in a house 30 ft. from the beginning of the dunes. Being landlocked for the last several years has made me appreciate the time I get on the ocean. Lakes and springs just don&#39t cut it for me compared to the beach, not sure why maybe it&#39s because I grew up on the white, sugar sand beaches of the Gulf Coast of Florida.

                    We had family and friends come in from all over to relax for the week leading up to the wedding with us. Our days were spent lounging on the sand and swimming in the crystal clear water. The sunsets, as you can see, are second to none here on the Emerald Coast.

                    My dad rented some beach cruisers for the house, so at least we got to ride bikes even without ours. We rode through a couple of the quaint towns on 30A. Life moves more slowly in these little beach towns but if you were to ask any resident, they would say that&#39s exactly why they live there.

                    If you&#39ve never had the opportunity to check out the Gulf Coast, I highly recommend a vacation there. If you want the best weather, make sure to check out May or September. It&#39s still plenty warm enough for swimming but not so hot that you feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving. Regardless of when you go, I promise you won&#39t be disappointed.

                    I always have my bag packed, when it&#39s time to go I don&#39t spend time thinking about what I need. I take things out to wash and clean after a trip and then immediately place them back in the pack. I carry a 30 liter pack, I&#39m always looking for ways to lower the weight and hopefully get down to a 20 liter pack.

                    Today, I thought I would give you a glimpse into my 3 season pack. I would take this pack for a trip that was up to 5 days long. I look for things that pack down small and are lightweight but still provide the necessary protection.

                    I typically look for deals on gear and equipment so I can get the most for my money. Most of the things I&#39ve bought were from Sierra Trading Post, Moosejaw, and Amazon. Though I&#39m always looking for a deal I&#39m not afraid to spend the extra money on quality products that will last a long time.

                    Frugality is not the same as being cheap. People who are cheap want to spend the least amount possible on that purchase. The problem is the product often breaks down quicker and needs to be replaced causing you to spend more in the long run. Frugal people want to spend the least amount for the best quality for a product that will last the longest.

                    Getting away from it all is one of the best things you can do sometimes. When the stresses of modern day life become too much, sometimes getting out into the wilderness can be just what the doctor ordered. You come back refreshed and renewed and that&#39s exactly what happened to me this past weekend. Some friends and I got away to the Ocala National Forest for a little car camping.

                    When we arrived Friday evening it was already dark (which is always frustrating to set up a tent in) and rain was threatening. Thankfully the rain held off and we were able to get our tents up and fire going. We reheated some baked ziti that one of the friends had made and froze for our dinner. This turned out to be one of the nastiest meals I&#39ve had. Thankfully, when you&#39re hungry you just don&#39t care. The wood was a little wet and smoked a large amount because of that. This caused the ziti to have a smoked flavor that did not complement it. Between the four of us, we emptied about ⅓ of a container of parmesan on to the pasta (it was the only thing that seemed to neutralize the smoky flavor). The next few hours were us sitting around the fire sharing stories, cracking open a few beers, and of course, poking fun at the friend&#39s terribly executed dinner. We headed to bed but didn&#39t realize that we had a snorer amongst us. How I wish I would&#39ve grabbed ear plugs before bed. A night of tossing and turning attempting to block the noise was ahead of me.

                    Saturday morning I woke up early and went for a hike by myself around the lake. Everything was still in the forest except for a group of 4 deer who didn&#39t seem to care too much about me. They crossed the trail a few hundred feet ahead of me looking for breakfast. It was a peaceful time to relax and be alone with my thoughts. The beauty of nature always makes me contemplate what&#39s necessary in life. As I came back from my morning hike the whole campsite began to wake up and get their day started. I took another mid-morning hike with one of my friends. It was a great time to just hang out with him and catch up on life. The rest of the day was spent lounging around the campsite and throwing the football down by the lake.

                    That night, we met a group who definitely knew how to have a good time. They were celebrating a milestone, one of the guy&#39s 60th birthday. It was 4 friends and their families. Each had the exact same Jeep just in a different color. They had neon shirts, neon painted croquet balls, led string lights everywhere all of which corresponded to the color of their Jeep. They had black lights hooked up to their Jeeps to accentuate all the neon colors.

                    In speaking with them, they had met when they worked for their city to build a haunted house. They had done that for years and collected a large amount of haunted props throughout the years. They told me about how Halloween at their homes consists of house hopping between the 4 of them and checking out their incredibly elaborate displays. One guy had a &#34rain room&#34, in which he set up pipes to create fake rain as you walked across a bridge that would move due to hydraulics. Needless to say, they take Halloween to another level. I want to visit them in October and see these amazing houses.

                    Thankfully, I had ear plugs Saturday night. I slept like a rock and think I only woke up once. Sunday was our clean up and head out day. It put an end to an amazing weekend. It was unbelievable how quickly the time went by, I can&#39t wait to go again though. I hope if you haven&#39t been camping, you get out there and try it. Start with car camping and maybe you&#39ll eventually move into some more backcountry type through-hiking. Even if you don&#39t, just go be outdoors. There is so much outside our wifi and paved city streets. Also, become friends with the weird people at your campsite, they often provide the most memorable moments.

                    I grew up on the Panhandle of Florida with some of the world&#39s most beautiful beaches. At a young age, I fell in love with the outdoors. I remember spending hours pretending I was a spy or a soldier with the other boys my age in the woods around our neighborhood. As I got older, my fascination with the outdoors only grew. I bike to work just to get outside more, kayak when I can on the weekends, and take walks on local trails. I&#39m most at home outside the walls of my house.

                    As for the <a href='http://mountmckinney.com/campfirestories/'>Campfire Stories</a>, I will be bringing you tales from my time spent in the great outdoors. This could cover anything from backpacking in Denali, road trips to the Smokey Mountains, beach camping on the Gulf of Mexico, or even just a beautiful trail that I take with my lovely wife. I look forward to sharing these adventures with all of you. If you have a suggestion for where my next adventure should be, then I would love to hear your thoughts! Drop me an email or comment on my posts anytime.

                    If I am going to purchase something to use in the backcountry, I have to make sure I get the best product for the money. This is what I promise you, that when I give you a recommendation on what fixed blade knife to buy, how to survive a bear attack, or what food to eat on the trail know that it comes after a countless hours of research. You can think of my articles as a summary of opinions. Instead of you taking time to read all about what product, say a sleeping bag, to buy, I have done that for you.
