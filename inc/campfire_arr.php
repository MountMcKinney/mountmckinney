We parked at the Three Forks Trailhead and headed out on the East Cowpen trail. My friend had a running watch to measure our distance traveled as well as elevation changes throughout the trip. We started at an elevation of 3,200 ft. and began to descend into the Cohutta Wilderness.",

I had read some reviews of the area and some stories from the specific loop we were planning on doing and all the pictures were of people down by a river. What I didn&#39t realize was that the first time we&#39d see a river on the trail we took in would be when we got to the Jacks River after hiking just under 8 miles and dropping 2,000 ft. in elevation.",

We used the Sawyer Mini for water filtration. It is definitely one of the best purchases I&#39ve ever made, it&#39s ultra portable and cleans the water effectively.",
    "p4" => "We then had to wade our way through the stream a couple of times to get to an open area to make camp. Slipping my feet into the cold water stream water after a good day of hiking was one of the more refreshing feelings I&#39ve had. The area we found was right on the river bank, just far enough back to have dry, solid ground but still right on the river. We set up the camp, started a fire, and ate dinner. It was so peaceful out there. The sound of the river lulled me to sleep, well that is until 5 mins after closing my eyes when nature called. All that water I guzzled to get rehydrated was ready to be set free. I must have woken up 4-5 times that night.",

As we weaved our way around the river down we started to hear the thundering sound of a waterfall. The falls were beautiful, we just stopped and stared at them for awhile, neither of us wanting to move on. We pushed further to try and get different views of the natural beauty that was before us. After having our fill, who am I kidding I could still be there staring at them, we headed out on the trail back toward our car. We were at an elevation of 1,200 ft. now and were dreading the climb back.",
    "p6" => "The trail back was definitely painful, 2,000 ft. increase in 8 miles. We would boo out loud whenever the trail dropped in elevation for more than a few steps knowing that we would have to climb it again. The most frustrating thing was not the elevation increases, but that we thought there would be water on this trail. We quickly realized we were wrong and we would need to conserve water as we watched the trail we were on and the river part ways. We did stop for lunch at an area that clearly fed into the river, however, it had been dried up to mostly mud at this time of year.",
    "p7" => "If I was to do another hike in this area, which I would definitely not be opposed to, I would take the Jack&#39s River Trail the whole way. The lack of water on the trail we took was definitely a detriment to us staying an extra night out there. If we were take a trail that stayed on or close to the river the whole way we definitely would have stayed longer. Oh well, you live and you learn right? All in all we descended 2,000 ft. and ascended that same amount, as well as hiking a total of 20 miles. Definitely not a bad way to spend a Memorial Day weekend.",
    "p8" => "We stayed in Atlanta Sunday night so we would be fresh driving home the next day. That post backpacking shower is one of the best things that this life has to offer. After getting cleaned up, we went out for dinner at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur. Their beer selection was exactly what was needed after hiking 20 miles in 2 days. I don&#39t know if it was the best beer I&#39ve ever had but it definitely tasted like it.",

It was an amazing time, the weather wasn&#39t too hot and the thunderstorms subsided for a sunny weekend.",

You would never lug this thing into the backcountry, but it was every bit of car camping luxury.

We didn&#39t venture onto the Florida Trail which goes right near Juniper Spring, due to it not having much shade and it was already high 80s. We stuck to the short nature trails around the campground and the swimming area. While on our short hike, we snapped some shots of a few turtles sunbathing. It was a lazy Saturday for us and for all of nature. We made our way to the springs for a dip in the chilly spring waters. It felt amazing once we got in, but boy that initial descent into the water is painful.",
    "p4" => "After a late lunch and a game of bocce ball, we headed back to the springs for swimming round 2. The heat had subsided a good bit and that made the jump back into the water that much more freezing. We spent the afternoon relaxing, jumping off the platform into the water, and racing each other in the water. It was a wonderful day to get away from not only the heat but the city as well.

I say secured but what I mean is we thought they were secured. I learned two valuable lessons this past Tuesday, don&#39t skimp on a bike rack and make sure you&#39ve double and triple checked that you&#39ve installed it correctly. We were in such a hurry and it was the first time we had used our bike rack that I didn&#39t place the side straps in the position they needed to be. It was probably not best to try a new bike rack out for the first time on a multi-hour interstate trip...I guess I learned three valuable lessons then.",
    "p2" => "Anyway, we were on the interstate for 30 mins and everything seemed to be fine, I had been keeping a constant eye on the bikes to make sure they weren&#39t wobbling. Then not more than a minute later, we drove over a dip in the road. It was enough of a bounce to cause the lower bar to swing closed and caused the bikes to swing down toward the road. I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and inspected the bikes. Thankfully the only damage was that on my wife&#39s new bike (when I say new I mean one day old) the front tire had dragged on the asphalt and burned a hole in the tire and tube. It definitely could&#39ve been worse. We reattached the bikes and drove back the 30 mins home, put the bikes inside and headed out again. That was all the excitement we had this trip.",

Being landlocked for the last several years has made me appreciate the time I get on the ocean. Lakes and springs just don&#39t cut it for me compared to the beach, not sure why maybe it&#39s because I grew up on the white, sugar sand beaches of the Gulf Coast of Florida.",

Thankfully the rain held off and we were able to get our tents up and fire going. We reheated some baked ziti that one of the friends had made and froze for our dinner. This turned out to be one of the nastiest meals I&#39ve had. Thankfully, when you&#39re hungry you just don&#39t care. The wood was a little wet and smoked a large amount because of that. This caused the ziti to have a smoked flavor that did not complement it. Between the four of us, we emptied about ⅓ of a container of parmesan on to the pasta (it was the only thing that seemed to neutralize the smoky flavor). The next few hours were us sitting around the fire sharing stories, cracking open a few beers, and of course, poking fun at the friend&#39s terribly executed dinner. We headed to bed but didn&#39t realize that we had a snorer amongst us. How I wish I would&#39ve grabbed ear plugs before bed.

It was a peaceful time to relax and be alone with my thoughts. The beauty of nature always makes me contemplate what&#39s necessary in life. As I came back from my morning hike the whole campsite began to wake up and get their day started. I took another mid-morning hike with one of my friends. It was a great time to just hang out with him and catch up on life. The rest of the day was spent lounging around the campsite and throwing the football down by the lake.",
    "p4" => "That night, we met a group who definitely knew how to have a good time. They were celebrating a milestone, one of the guy&#39s 60th birthday. It was 4 friends and their families. Each had the exact same Jeep just in a different color. They had neon shirts, neon painted croquet balls, led string lights everywhere all of which corresponded to the color of their Jeep. They had black lights hooked up to their Jeeps to accentuate all the neon colors.",

They had done that for years and collected a large amount of haunted props throughout the years. They told me about how Halloween at their homes consists of house hopping between the 4 of them and checking out their incredibly elaborate displays. One guy had a &#34rain room&#34, in which he set up pipes to create fake rain as you walked across a bridge that would move due to hydraulics. Needless to say, they take Halloween to another level. I want to visit them in October and see these amazing houses.",

It was unbelievable how quickly the time went by, I can&#39t wait to go again though. I hope if you haven&#39t been camping, you get out there and try it. Start with car camping and maybe you&#39ll eventually move into some more backcountry type through-hiking. Even if you don&#39t, just go be outdoors. There is so much outside our wifi and paved city streets. Also, become friends with the weird people at your campsite, they often provide the most memorable moments.",
