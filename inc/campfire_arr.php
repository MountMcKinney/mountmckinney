However, the experience was enough for me to spend money to ensure the safety of my belongings. I went home, got on Amazon, and bought a waterproof backpack from Overboard. Now, almost 4 years later, it&#39s still my go to backpack. I ride my bike to work a large amount of the time. It is not uncommon to get stuck in a downpour and my Overboard pack protects my belongings. What does this have to do with camping deep in the woods?",
    "p2" => "Well, the Overboard pack is still my choice of backpack, even when hiking. I know that it doesn&#39t have the internal frame that traditional packs have and doesn&#39t have all the bells and whistles that other packs have. For me though, it&#39s exactly what I need. When I&#39m out hiking in the woods, the last thing I want to think about is if my sleeping bag, tent, and clothes are going to get soaked if a thunderstorm rolls in. I know they have rain covers for regular packs but why buy something extra on top of an already expensive pack?",

For far less than a typical pack I get IP66 protection and while that means it&#39s not completely waterproof it performs more than satisfactory. It has a pocket on each side as well as an internal pocket and has various loops to clip items to it on the outside. I am always looking for an upgraded pack that is extremely light and waterproof at the same time, but I rarely find any that offer what I&#39m looking for. If they do, they are often quite expensive and don&#39t offer a large enough improvement to justify the cost.",

There was a great sale so I picked it up. I tried packing all the things I had packed in my 30L pack and found it to be more difficult. Maybe it&#39s the way space is used in the Sea to Summit versus the Overboard. Possibly it was because of the difference in shape, the rectangular Overboard versus the cylindrical Sea to Summit. I&#39m not sure why it didn&#39t fit as much. This was the bag I had wanted for a few months and when I got it I was disappointed. So for now I will continue to use my Overboard pack.",

I learned two valuable lessons this past Tuesday, don&#39t skimp on a bike rack and make sure you&#39ve double and triple checked that you&#39ve installed it correctly. We were in such a hurry and it was the first time we had used our bike rack that I didn&#39t place the side straps in the position they needed to be. It was probably not best to try a new bike rack out for the first time on a multi-hour interstate trip...I guess I learned three valuable lessons then.",
    "p2" => "Anyway, we were on the interstate for 30 mins and everything seemed to be fine, I had been keeping a constant eye on the bikes to make sure they weren&#39t wobbling. Then not more than a minute later, we drove over a dip in the road. It was enough of a bounce to cause the lower bar to swing closed and caused the bikes to swing down toward the road. I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and inspected the bikes. Thankfully the only damage was that on my wife&#39s new bike (when I say new I mean one day old) the front tire had dragged on the asphalt and burned a hole in the tire and tube. It definitely could&#39ve been worse. We reattached the bikes and drove back the 30 mins home, put the bikes inside and headed out again. That was all the excitement we had this trip.",

It was the week leading up to my brother&#39s wedding, and my family and I spent 5 days in a house 30 ft. from the beginning of the dunes. Being landlocked for the last several years has made me appreciate the time I get on the ocean. Lakes and springs just don&#39t cut it for me compared to the beach, not sure why maybe it&#39s because I grew up on the white, sugar sand beaches of the Gulf Coast of Florida.",
    "p4" => "We had family and friends come in from all over to relax for the week leading up to the wedding with us. Our days were spent lounging on the sand and swimming in the crystal clear water. The sunsets, as you can see, are second to none here on the Emerald Coast.",

    "p6" => "If you&#39ve never had the opportunity to check out the Gulf Coast, I highly recommend a vacation there. If you want the best weather, make sure to check out May or September. It&#39s still plenty warm enough for swimming but not so hot that you feel like a turkey on Thanksgiving. Regardless of when you go, I promise you won&#39t be disappointed.",

Thankfully the rain held off and we were able to get our tents up and fire going. We reheated some baked ziti that one of the friends had made and froze for our dinner. This turned out to be one of the nastiest meals I&#39ve had. Thankfully, when you&#39re hungry you just don&#39t care. The wood was a little wet and smoked a large amount because of that. This caused the ziti to have a smoked flavor that did not complement it. Between the four of us, we emptied about ⅓ of a container of parmesan on to the pasta (it was the only thing that seemed to neutralize the smoky flavor). The next few hours were us sitting around the fire sharing stories, cracking open a few beers, and of course, poking fun at the friend&#39s terribly executed dinner. We headed to bed but didn&#39t realize that we had a snorer amongst us. How I wish I would&#39ve grabbed ear plugs before bed.

It was a peaceful time to relax and be alone with my thoughts. The beauty of nature always makes me contemplate what&#39s necessary in life. As I came back from my morning hike the whole campsite began to wake up and get their day started. I took another mid-morning hike with one of my friends. It was a great time to just hang out with him and catch up on life. The rest of the day was spent lounging around the campsite and throwing the football down by the lake.",

They had done that for years and collected a large amount of haunted props throughout the years. They told me about how Halloween at their homes consists of house hopping between the 4 of them and checking out their incredibly elaborate displays. One guy had a &#34rain room&#34, in which he set up pipes to create fake rain as you walked across a bridge that would move due to hydraulics. Needless to say, they take Halloween to another level. I want to visit them in October and see these amazing houses.",

It was unbelievable how quickly the time went by, I can&#39t wait to go again though. I hope if you haven&#39t been camping, you get out there and try it. Start with car camping and maybe you&#39ll eventually move into some more backcountry type through-hiking. Even if you don&#39t, just go be outdoors. There is so much outside our wifi and paved city streets. Also, become friends with the weird people at your campsite, they often provide the most memorable moments.",
