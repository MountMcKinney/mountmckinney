        <h6>Why Mount McKinney?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            So glad you asked! We created a page specifically for that very question. <a href='http://localhost/why-us'>Why Us?</a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">How much does a website cost?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            The short answer: Our prices vary depending on your needs. We would never give you a quote without talking to you and figuring out the specifics. However, based on prior experience we do have ballpark ranges on our <a href='http://localhost/service/?service=web-development'>Web Development & Design</a> page.
            <br/ >
            <br/ >
            The long answer: To truly find what it will cost, we need to have a conversation with you. We are all about relationships here at Mount McKinney and we need to find out what functionality you need in a site, what the site&apos;s purpose is, etc. After speaking with you we can work on a firm quote taking into account your specific situation and needs.
            <br />
            <br/ >
            Just like most things that are as variable as building a website, if a web developer gives you an instant quote, run away like you&apos;re being chased by <span>Sasquatch</span>! (Perferrably right to us!)
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>Company X says they&apos;ll make the site for $500. Why shouldn&apos;t we hire them instead?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            In websites, just like in life, <strong>you get what you pay for</strong>. Real web development and design takes time, effort, and money.
            <br />
            <br />
            A $500 site, will either be done way too quickly (meaning they didn&apos;t take the necessary time to actually create something beautiful) or will be finished months late. In all likelihood, it will be someone slapping your content onto a template on WordPress with no thought about whether it looks good or not. For some people, this is fine, not us though. We want to create something memorable and beautiful for you.
            <br />
            <br />
            That&apos;s all assuming they won&apos;t come back after you&apos;ve signed the contract with a bunch of hidden costs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Worst of all, they likely won&apos;t be responsive. <strong>Mount McKinney is all about relationships</strong>. We want to forge a lasting relationship with you your peak! As such, we respond to emails quickly even if it is just to let you know that we need a few hours to respond. We don&apos;t &quot;go dark&quot; on you. Ever.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">What if I want to make changes?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            Changes to the site are to be expected. Sometimes when you see something actually on screen it doesn&apos;t come across like you imagined. That&apos;s why Mount McKinney is happy to make changes to your site throughout development or even after go-live.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Small changes</strong> such as choosing different fonts, different colors, etc. are no cost. You can let us know you would like those changed and we will either make the change immediately or show you a side-by-side comparison of the original to the proposed changes so you can make an informed choice about what to go with.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Major changes</strong> such as adding an entire new page, adding functionality like a blog or a shop, etc. will require an add-on quote. We will never do work without getting your approval on this new quote first. If you need something added, you can let us know and we will be happy to send a quote to you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>Will my website work on mobile devices?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            Yes! We use all current design principals. One of which is responsive design where content will automatically resize based on the screen size.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">Do you offer copywriting or photography services?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            At this time we don&apos;t offer either directly. However, we do have a network of highly skilled creative associates who we can connect you with.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>How does payment work?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            Payment is different depending on the service provided. For most web development & design and logo design are typically paid with a 50% deposit. Upon completion of the site, the other 50% is due before we officially hand over any files. A large project will require a 40% deposit, another 30% will be due at the halfway point of the project, and the last 30% will be due upon completion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our <a href="http://localhost/service/?service=quick-fix">Quick Fixes</a>, <a href="http://localhost/service/?service=care-plan">Monthly Website Care Plans</a>, and <a href="http://localhost/service/?service=wordpress-care-plan">Monthly WordPress Care Plans</a> are paid in advance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">Do you offer a referral bonus?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            We do! Just have them let us know you referred them and we&apos;ll offer you a discount on your next project!
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>Do I own the website you create?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            Absolutely! Everything we create is 100% yours. However, we do retain the right to re-use any code we create for other sites.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">What am I responsible for during the development process?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            The biggest thing you are responsible for is being timely with content we request(we will always let you know well in advance when we will need content by). This keeps the project from being held up. If you need a copywriter or a photographer we can connect you to one in our network.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you provide us with an image or some other creative for use on your site, we make the legal assumption that you have the legal rights to use that image. Mount McKinney bears no responsibility if you provide us with an image and it turns out to infringe on a copyright.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, treat us how you would like to be treated.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>How long will my site take?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            We will provide you a timeline with the quote so you can know before we start when you can expect to have your shiny new site.
            <br>
            <br>
            A site&apos;s timeline can vary greatly due to your specific situation. An average site will take 2-4 weeks but this can be increased due to site complexity and revisions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="altRow">Can I see my site while it&apos;s in development?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
            Of course! We will provide you with a link to see the status of your site while it&apos;s being created. If you see something you don&apos;t like, let us know!
          </p>
        </div>
        <h6>Do you provide site maintenance and updates?</h6>
        <div>
          <p>
